I have also been speaking to Johnnie Brown in San Antonio to be the general contractor.  According to Johnnie, I would not be pay any less buying from the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within his region.  Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him.  I believe he has sent you my plans.  They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects.  

Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from the distributor?  If you have the estimates worked up for Johnnie will you please email them to me as well?

Thank you for your time.  I am excited about potentially using your product.

The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.

Enron Freight Markets has continued to expand the transportation services offered to its customers and completed several flatbed truck moves outbound from Georgia this week.  There was a shortage of flatbed equipment supply in this market and EFM was able to obtain more than three times the normal margin on each move.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
EIM has recently formed a Forest Products Origination team led by Rob Saltiel to pursue structured transactions.  Typically, these deals employ a combination of physical supply/offtake, price risk management and/or finance to bring value to Enron and our customers.  Priority commodities include pulp, newsprint, recycled papers, linerboard, and lumber.  Response to the new team's efforts has been positive, as many of the Forest Products companies have needs for commodity and capital solutions that are currently unavailable.  

Enron Freight Markets
During its first month in the over-the-road (OTR) trucking business, Enron Freight Markets has completed over 120 spot OTR trades.  On Friday, March 18, there was a shortage in the Houston outbound market and capacity was selling for $1.65 per mile.  By comparison, average market price has stayed in the $1.05-$1.10 per mile range in recent weeks.

EnronOnline
On May 23, Enron Corp. announced that it completed its one-millionth transaction on EnronOnline, the world's largest web-based e-commerce platform for commodities. As an online extension of its successful wholesale energy business, EnronOnline began transacting natural gas and electricity on November 29, 1999.  Since that time, the company has extended the platform to approximately 1500 wholesale commodity products ranging from energy-related commodities to bandwidth, metals, forest products, plastics, petrochemicals, and weather and credit derivatives.

Approximately 60 percent of all Enron transactions are now conducted online, and the cost of processing the transactions has been reduced by 75 percent.

Enron Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling likes to say that the nation's leading energy merchant was ready for the Internet long before there was anything.com. Enron's business of buying and selling commodities - by phone or fax - was a natural fit for the Web. The challenge now is to get the new broadband Internet trading unit on solid footing by proving that bandwidth can be traded like a commodity. BusinessWeek e.biz/May 14,2001.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

PUC sweats $4.8 billion rate raise
By Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writer
(Published May 10, 2001)=20
Big industries' electric bills would leap 50 percent or more and household=
=20
bills would rise an average of 11 percent to 17 percent under two proposals=
=20
outlined by state regulators Wednesday for revamping electric rates.=20
The twin proposals are efforts by Loretta Lynch, president of the state=20
Public Utilities Commission, and Christine Walwyn, a PUC administrative=20
judge, to decide how to divide the burden of a $4.8 billion rate hike.=20
""Both of them are just going to be very, very hard on business,"" said Bill=
=20
Booth, an attorney for the California Large Energy Consumers Association. H=
e=20
said it appeared that some cement and steel makers could face 90 percent ra=

hikes.=20
But small consumers were equally dismayed.=20
""This never should have happened in the first place,"" said Bob Finkelstein,=
=20
an attorney with The Utility Reform Network, placing the blame for soaring=
=20
rates on electric deregulation.=20
""In terms of allocating the fallout from the failed experiment, they seemed=
=20
to do a reasonable job. But it assumes that the fallout should be allocated=

in the first place, and that just sticks in our craw,"" he said.=20
Several PUC commissioners have said they want to select a new rate design a=

a special meeting Monday, so the higher electric bills can begin going out=

June 1 to customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California=
=20

One version before the PUC would include Lynch's call to begin looking for=
=20
ways to charge federal installations power rates that are tied to wildly=20
gyrating wholesale costs.=20
Reportedly first floated as a joke, the idea quickly took hold within the=

PUC. Lynch said she wants to set it up as ""pilot program,"" perhaps beginnin=
g=20
in mid-summer, so the federal government can test its own theories about=20
unfettered market prices being good for consumers.=20
""I don't believe it's a dig at the FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory=20
Commission),"" she said during a news conference.=20
But she repeated her attack on federal regulators, saying electric rates ar=
e=20
rising in California only because the FERC has refused to cap runaway=20
wholesale electric prices.=20
Commissioner Richard Bilas later called a special federal rate ""silly"" and=
=20
""kindergartenish,"" and said the proposal was clearly intended ""just to get=
=20
back at the federal government.""=20
Any of the five appointed commissioners can offer an alternate version of t=
he=20
rate design, as Lynch did. The alternates will be considered alongside the=
=20
proposal by Walwyn, the judge who presided over lengthy hearings on how the=
=20
new rates should be crafted.=20
She recommended increases that would fall slightly more softly on residenti=
al=20
customers -- averaging 11 percent for Edison and 15 percent for PG&E -- and=
=20
more heavily on large industrial users, averaging 52 percent for Edison and=
=20
55 percent for PG&E.=20
But within those averages could be much higher individual increases, and=20
advocates for everyone from farmers to manufacturers waited anxiously=20
throughout the day for detailed tables that would list rates for dozens of=

customer categories.=20
""I have got my expert economist standing by to look at the numbers when the=

The release of the rate proposal has been delayed repeatedly as the PUC tri=

arguing for changes.=20
""We have to file comments on this by Friday. What they're doing is, they're=

shutting down the comment period,"" said Jack Stewart, president of the=20
California Manufacturers & Technology Association.=20
He said it appears that some rates could nearly double, and ""that's just a=

She said that about half of households statewide would see no increase unde=

amount. However, PG&E has calculated that far more households -- 69 percent=
=20
-- use more than the baseline at some point during the year.=20
PG&E's baseline varies by region and season but generally runs between 300=
=20
and 400 kilowatt-hours, or about 50 percent to 60 percent of average=20
electricity use per household. It was created to give people access to a=20

more.=20
Lynch and Walwyn also have proposed ""bill limiters"" so that businesses with=

?????The rate hike, Lynch said at a news conference, is necessary because=

""federal regulators have failed to follow federal laws to ensure just and=

?????The deepening energy crisis compelled Lynch to release her proposal=20
after public hearings on the rate increase already had begun. Lynch said th=

she wished her proposal had been ready sooner, but that at least some of th=

remaining public hearings will have the benefit of reviewing it.
?????PUC passage of the essential elements of Lynch's plan seems likely.
?????Along with two of her colleagues on the five-member commission, Lynch=

This week, the commission is conducting statewide hearings on how the pain=

should be shared among millions of residents and businesses. On Monday the=

panel is set to vote on Lynch's plan and a similar one by a PUC=20
administrative law judge.
?????Neither proposal appeared to please anyone.
?????""The PUC says everyone should share the pain, but we think the fair=20
share of the pain for residential consumers should be zero,"" said Mindy=20
Spatt, spokeswoman for the Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco consumer=

group. ""It should be paid by commercial and industrial customers who wanted=

?????Consumer activist Harvey Rosenfield said regulators should go after=20
power generators and their hefty profits rather than ratepayers.
?????""Rate increases are not the answer, and this is not going to be the en=

?????Commercial and industrial customers would see increases of up to 50%,=

?????Unlike residential customers, the business customers are not grouped=

when the rate hikes will start showing up on bills.

the commission president said that goal could not be immediately achieved=

without seriously damaging the state's economy.
?????To protect the largest users from gigantic rate increases, Lynch's=20

customers who already receive discounted electricity rates.
?????Edison and PG&E said they could not assess how the PUC proposals would=

utilities as of late Wednesday.
?????But PG&E has disputed the commission's claim that half of customers=20

?????Industrial and commercial customers complained that the plan should no=

?????If the PUC insists on exempting so many, the $1-billion shortfall shou=

?????Under Lynch's plan the burden of paying that amount would be split=20

In Office Buildings, the Lights Are On, But Nobody's Home=20
Energy: Analysts say metering individual tenants could encourage=20
conservation.=20

By JERRY HIRSCH, Times Staff Writer=20

?????Despite power outages and soaring energy prices, workers stream out of=
=20
California's downtown and suburban offices each evening leaving lights=20
blazing and computers humming. And there has been scant incentive to=20
conserve, since commercial building leases typically include the cost of=20
energy.
?????Energy experts and other analysts say metering of individual office=20
tenants would encourage conservation by pushing companies to shut off light=
s,=20
computer monitors, desk fans and other electrical devices at night, but sta=
te=20
regulations and utility policies are in the way.
?????That conflict between policy and conservation efforts has drawn the=20
attention of state Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey), who chairs the Sena=
te=20
Energy, Utilities and Communications Committee. On Tuesday, Bowen asked=20
California Public Utilities Chairwoman Loretta Lynch to review what Bowen=
=20
called ""archaic"" regulations governing how electricity meters are used in=
=20
office buildings. Bowen said she also plans to take up the issue in her=20
committee.
?????At issue is Rule 18, a regulation established by the commission two=20
decades ago that prohibits landlords from using submeters to assess energy=
=20
charges to tenants.
?????""It is quite old and dates back to a different era of electricity=20
distribution in California,"" said Bowen, who was urged to take action by th=
e=20
Building Owners and Managers Assn. ""I asked Loretta Lynch to open a=20
proceeding to revise or eliminate that ban.""
?????Lynch did not return calls for comment on the state's metering policie=
s,=20
but PUC regulatory analyst William Gaffney said more metering ""would be a=
=20
boon to energy conservation"" because ""you could see what you are using.""
?????""Direct metering would ultimately foster greater energy savings . . .=
=20
more permanent savings, because it would encourage capital investments in=
=20
more efficient equipment, windows, etc., etc.,"" said Evan Mills, a scientis=
t=20
in the energy analysis department of the Lawrence Berkeley National=20
Laboratory in Berkeley.
?????Usually, the only tenants in office buildings with utility meters are=
=20
retail and restaurant businesses, according to commercial real estate=20
experts. Most tenants in California office towers sign what are called ""gro=
ss=20
leases"" that include power. When electricity usage or rates go up=20
unexpectedly, landlords can charge monthly or annual ""escalation fees"" to=
=20
cover the extra cost. The fees typically are apportioned by the percentage =
of=20
the building a tenant occupies.
?????This method of billing is counterproductive to energy savings, said=20
Willet Kempton, senior policy scientist at the University of Delaware's=20
Center for Energy and Environmental Policy. Energy hogs are subsidized by=
=20
other tenants. Conversely, savings through conservation are only fractional=
ly=20
shared.
?????Two key obstacles block metering of individual tenants in a building.
?????One is economics--high-rise buildings get a far better rate with one=
=20
utility meter than if each floor is metered.
?????""We can sell a lot of energy on just one bill,"" said Randy Howard,=20
manager of commercial services at the Los Angeles Department of Water and=
=20
Power. ""If we had 200 meters there and had to do the billing and meter=20
reading for each of them, each tenant would pay a higher rate.""
?????Moreover, utilities aren't anxious to send meter readers to every floo=
r=20
of a building, going through private offices to find the meters. One=20
alternative--locating all the meters in a central area where the main=20
electrical line enters the building--would require massive rewiring of=20
existing office towers that could cost several hundred thousand dollars or=
=20
more, depending on the size of the building, said Ali Sherafat, senior vice=
=20
president of the Los Angeles office of Syska & Hennessy, a consulting=20
engineering firm.
?????A 1995 ruling by the PUC required that individual tenants in office=20
buildings be placed on meters operated by a public utility (as opposed to=
=20
landlord-managed submeters), but relatively few have been installed because=
=20
of exemptions.
?????For example, Southern California Edison Co. officials typically meet=
=20
with developers at the start of a building project to determine how many=20
meters it might require, said Matt Deatherage, a planning support manager f=
or=20
the utility. But because developers build office space so that its=20
configuration can change easily as tenants shift, the estimate is often=20
wrong. A building designed with three meters for three tenants might find=
=20
itself with six tenants or more by the time it opens.
?????""We don't require them to go back and rewire the building if it turns=
=20
out to be wrong, that would be too expensive,"" Deatherage said.
?????The second obstacle is Rule 18, the 1981 ban on submetering originally=
=20
intended to protect utility monopolies and to prevent landlords from gettin=
g=20
electricity at a discount price and selling it at a markup to tenants.
?????""When you resell electricity like that, you function as a utility and=
=20
that's not allowed,"" said Deatherage.
?????Nonetheless, Bowen believes that deregulation may have superseded thos=
e=20
issues and that current policy should emphasize conservation.
?????Although the leasing model used in California is common, it's not=20
universal, said Peter L. DiCapua, energy chairman of the Building Owners an=
d=20
Managers Assn. International.
?????Many New York tenants have individual meters. Others are on landlord=
=20
submeters, a system that allows them to tap into the lower, high-volume rat=
es=20
paid by the building's operator but still pay for actual, rather than=20
estimated, energy use.=20
?????Landlords would welcome a changed regulation to allow submetering for=
=20
several reasons. There are the conservation benefits, said Dan Emmett, chie=
f=20
executive of Douglas Emmett & Co., one of the largest building owners and=
=20
managers in Los Angeles County. It also would reduce some of the inevitable=
=20
arguments with tenants who claim they pay more than their fair share for=20
services at a building.
?????""I think submetering could be practical,"" Emmett said. ""It is not that=
=20
complicated and is fairly inexpensive.""
?????Sherafat said it would cost about $2,000 per tenant for the submeter a=
nd=20
the necessary software. Submeters could be installed at the electrical pane=
l=20
level without expensive rewiring for utility meters, he said. Better yet, t=
he=20
software allows data to be collected at a central point, eliminating the ne=
ed=20
for meter readers. Such a system also could allow big buildings to use one=
=20
master meter to get the best rate .
?????Though submetering would foster conservation, it still is not a panace=
a,=20
said Kempton of the University of Delaware. When it comes to energy=20
conservation, changing the behavior of businesses and workers is notoriousl=
y=20
tricky.
?????""Attorneys literally can't be bothered with the nuances of energy,"" sa=
id=20
DiCapua, an executive at Atco Properties & Management in New York. ""They ar=
e=20
focused on things other than if the air conditioning was left on all night.
?????That is typical of professional services firms, because energy is just=
 a=20
small fraction of their expenses, Kempton said.
?????And individual metering sounds great in theory, Kempton added, but it =
is=20
useless if the bill goes to a home office elsewhere or if the on-site manag=

?????In any push to change the rules, however, people should remember that=

The power cutoff sent the ISO into a panic, since BC Hydro was providing=20

Power bills set to skyrocket for heavy users=20
Graduated rate increase would take effect in June=20

.DTL=20

As state regulators outlined plans to raise residential electricity bills b=
y=20
as much as 40 percent, the head of the Public Utilities Commission warned=
=20
yesterday that power rates could soar even higher.=20
The PUC, which adopted an increase in March, is scheduled to approve detail=
s=20
of the new rates in San Francisco on Monday. Consumers will see the higher=
=20
rates in their June utility bills.=20
State regulators say nearly half of all consumers will see no change in the=
ir=20
power bills. The remainder will experience rate increases ranging from 3=20
percent to more than 50 percent, depending on the type of customer and the=
=20
amount of power used.=20
The increases would be added to an average 10 percent increase adopted in=
=20
January.=20
PUC President Loretta Lynch suggested that rates could rise yet again if=20
wholesale electricity prices continue to surge this summer.=20
""If the sellers decide to turn up the heat and raise prices, we'll have to=
=20
look again at the numbers,"" she said.=20
INCREASE WILL CONTRIBUTE LITTLE
The proposed rate increase would bring in about $5 billion annually -- a=20
fraction of the estimated $65 billion California will spend this year=20
purchasing power on behalf of the state's cash-strapped utilities.=20
Lynch said she expects the remainder to be made up by issuing bonds. The=20
state Senate yesterday approved $13.4 billion in bonds to help cover=20
California's power costs.=20
However, those bonds would not be released until August, by which time=20
California's energy tab would be billions of dollars higher.=20
""There's huge cause for concern that this latest rate increase is a down=20
payment rather than anything close to a final installment,"" said Bob=20
Finkelstein, staff attorney for The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco=
.=20
The PUC's Lynch stressed that while California's new rate structure would=
=20
place a greater burden on the state's heaviest power users, the increases a=
re=20
intended to spread the pain among all consumers.=20
""Energy is expensive for every hour of every day for every customer,"" she=
=20
said.=20
LINING UP TO GET PAID
That includes the state Department of Water Resources, which is spending=20
about $70 million a day to keep California's lights on.=20
While the PUC is moving to have more money collected from consumers to pay=
=20
California's power bills, it has yet to address the thorny question of how=
=20
the proceeds will be distributed among the various parties lined up for=20
compensation.=20
The Water Resources Department wants all rate-related revenues to first=20
replenish state coffers, while Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern=20
California Edison Co. insist that they be paid as well for their own=20
expenses.=20
The utilities' costs include payments to small power generators that can no=
=20
longer afford natural gas to run their plants. The recent closure of hundre=
ds=20
of such facilities is a key reason California is experiencing blackouts thi=
s=20
week.=20
Although PG&E said yesterday that most of the smaller generators with which=
=20
it does business are now back online, it is not yet clear whether the utili=
ty=20
will be able to keep paying for their power.=20
""It appears that everything (from the rate increase) is going to DWR (the=
=20
Water Resources Department),"" said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman.=20
Lynch said the PUC will take up the matter of apportioning funds at an=20
unspecified future date.=20
CONSERVATIVE USE PAYS
For the moment, state regulators have their hands full digesting two=20
competing -- and highly complex -- proposals for how rates should be=20
increased next week.=20
One proposal was submitted by an administrative law judge working with the=
=20
PUC and the other by Lynch. Commissioners will choose between them on Monda=
y.=20
The two proposals are largely identical. Under both, residential customers=
=20
who can keep electricity usage within 130 percent of predetermined limits=
=20
would experience no rate increase.=20
The ""baseline usage"" figure -- included near the bottom of PG&E bills --=20
represents the minimal amount of power consumers require. It includes a=20
number of variables, such as climate, time of year and type of fuel used.=
=20
The PUC said about half of all utility customers statewide historically sta=
y=20
within 130 percent of baseline limits.=20
Heavy residential users whose electricity usage tops 400 percent of baselin=
e=20
figures would see power bills rise by as much as 40 percent. Heavy commerci=
al=20
and industrial users would see bills rise by more than 50 percent.=20
The average increase for all PG&E residential customers would be about 16=
=20
percent, the PUC said, although this number is skewed by the addition of al=
l=20
those customers whose bills would remain unchanged.=20
Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights =
in=20
Santa Monica, questioned whether these rate increases will be sufficient to=
=20
motivate greater conservation among consumers and thus ease California's=20
energy woes.=20
He called instead for the state's political leaders to seize generating=20
plants from out-of-state power companies and impose a special tax on the=20
companies' ""windfall"" profits.=20
""Unless our elected officials take action, this is just the beginning of ou=
r=20
rate increases,"" Rosenfield warned.=20
FEDERAL BUILDINGS IN SIGHTS
One of the main differences between the two rate-increase proposals is=20
Lynch's inclusion of a ""real-time pricing program"" for federal agencies.=20
If enacted, she said, federal buildings in California would be fully expose=
d=20
to the volatile wholesale power market and would pay whatever California pa=
ys=20
to keep the lights on throughout the day.=20
Lynch denied that this is an effort on the part of California officials to=
=20
drive home to federal authorities the impact of sky-high wholesale=20
electricity prices.=20
""It's just an experiment,"" she said.=20
While California officials have called on federal regulators and the Bush=
=20
administration to assist the state by capping wholesale power prices,=20
Washington has provided only limited relief to date.=20
The Utility Reform Network's Finkelstein complained that the proposed rate=
=20
increases place a severe burden on residential customers when commercial an=
d=20
industrial users account for the greater percentage of power consumption.=
=20
""It was the commercial and industrial customers who were clamoring for=20
deregulation,"" he said. ""You didn't hear any calls for deregulation from=20
residential customers.""=20
Lynch said she was aware that residential users are being asked to carry a=
=20
high proportion of the load but said efforts to force industrial users to p=
ay=20
higher rates ran into political opposition.=20

Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis, who has portrayed power generators as greedy=
=20
villains in the state's power crisis, met face-to-face with industry=20
officials yesterday, calling on them to forgive some of the debt racked up =
by=20
an insolvent utility.=20
In a three-hour meeting described as ""businesslike,"" Davis said generators=
=20
will have to accept 70 cents on the dollar of past debt as part of a soluti=
on=20
designed to prevent Southern California Edison Co. from going bankrupt.=20
At least one of the companies flatly rejected the idea after the meeting,=
=20
putting the deal in jeopardy.=20
If the two sides are not able to reach an agreement, Southern California=20
Edison would probably follow Pacific Gas & Electric Co. into bankruptcy=20
court, where creditors face a lengthy and uncertain resolution to recoverin=
g=20
debts.=20
Davis has run into legislative opposition to the original terms of the=20
agreement he brokered with Southern California Edison, which includes the=
=20
state's purchase of the utility's transmission lines as a way to help it=20
regain financial stability.=20
But the governor said he now believes that the deal can win passage in the=
=20
Legislature if the generators ""take a haircut.""=20
""I indicated that passage of the (agreement) that we signed with Edison wou=
ld=20
only work if they agreed to reduce the amount of money they claim the=20
utilities owe them,"" he said.=20
Edison owes generators, including municipal utilities, between $1.1 billion=
=20
and $1.2 billion, Davis said. He said he agreed that talks would also take=
=20
place with municipal utilities about taking less money on the dollar.=20
Most of the generators refused to comment on the proposal, but a=20
representative of Reliant Energy dismissed the suggestion.=20
""That's simply an unreasonable number to start with,"" said John Stout, seni=
or=20
vice president of Reliant, who said that 67 cents on every dollar the compa=
ny=20
receives goes to pay the fuel bill, which doesn't include personnel and=20
maintenance of facilities.=20
""It doesn't get any supply built,"" Stout said of the idea. ""I would much=20
rather get that 100 cents on the dollar"" to invest in new generation.=20
The generators, who have reaped huge profits in the past year, said the mai=
n=20
thrust of the meeting was on short-term issues, such as lining up more powe=
r=20
for the summer.=20
Davis asked which companies were not yet selling to the state and said he=
=20
would work to get the Department of Water Resources to sign agreements with=
=20
them.=20
He also asked the generators to support the Edison deal, reportedly asking=
=20
them to try to win GOP support for it.=20
Davis agreed to a proposal from the companies to form permanent working=20
groups to deal with the crisis.=20
A handful of protesters led by former Senate candidate Medea Benjamin=20
condemned Davis for meeting with the companies. Dressed as pigs, with the=
=20
names of the companies on their masks, the five protesters brought a small=
=20
live pig into the Capitol, where it proceeded to defecate outside the=20
governor's office before the group was escorted out of the building.=20
Lawmakers have insisted that the generators must take a cut in the money th=
ey=20
are owed as part of any deal ending the energy crisis.=20
Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, said earlier in the=
=20
day that at least a 30 percent ""haircut"" would be necessary before he would=
=20
allow any deal to be approved.=20
""What we have here is a problem caused by the unfettered greed of generator=
s=20
that has brought capitalism to a new low,"" Burton said.=20
He said if the generators don't agree to some kind of cut, they will find=
=20
themselves in bankruptcy court.=20
Earlier in the day, the Senate approved a bill that allows the state=20
treasurer to issue $13.4 billion in bonds. The money, which will eventually=
=20
be repaid by ratepayers, will be used to replace the funds that have draine=

out of the state's general fund since January to buy electricity and pay fo=

The state has spent about $6 billion so far -- money, Democrats argue, that=

has to be replaced in order to fund other state services.=20
""Where do those revenues go?"" asked Sen. Sheila Kuehl, D-Santa Monica, duri=

Rate plans shield most households=20

Mercury News=20

State regulators on Wednesday painted the clearest picture yet of who will=
=20
bear the brunt of the biggest electrical rate hike in 20 years: Commercial,=
=20
industrial and agricultural users will be socked with power bills that coul=
d=20
soar by 50 percent or more.=20
But most residential customers will be shielded from huge rate increases,=
=20
regulators said. In two proposals unveiled Wednesday by the California Publ=
ic=20
Utilities Commission and to be voted on Monday, only the heaviest residenti=
al=20
users get hit with big hikes, potentially doubling their rates in an effort=
=20
to push them toward conservation.=20
``The moderate users will be largely protected,'' said PUC chairwoman Loret=
ta=20
Lynch.=20
The PUC has been grappling with designing a rate plan for customers since=
=20
March, when it announced an across-the-board rate hike of 3 cents per=20
kilowatt-hour. The PUC announced the increase -- designed to help the state=
=20
climb out of its ongoing power crisis -- before deciding how the rate=20
structure would work and considered at least 20 plans.=20
Details of the proposals were criticized Wednesday by energy experts who sa=
id=20
residential customers are not being charged enough to encourage conservatio=
n,=20
and by business representatives who said business and commercial users are=
=20
being unfairly targeted.=20
``This is not a real rate increase for the residential class and we need=20
one,'' said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California=20
Energy Institute. ``This is ridiculous. This is not a way to respond. This=
=20
will send no price signal to people at all.''=20
Both proposals create a five-tier billing system for residential customers,=
=20
with heavy users -- nearly 10 percent of all households -- seeing their rat=
es=20
possibly double. Energy misers and moderate users -- the other 7.3 million=
=20
households -- would either see no change at all in their bills or only mode=
st=20
increases of up to about $12 month.=20
The consumer group the Utility Reform Network said it was generally satisfi=
ed=20
with the rate plans and how they spread the increase across all customer=20
groups.=20
``Yes, they've done a reasonable job of allocating the pain equitably,'' sa=
id=20
Bob Finkelstein, a staff attorney with the organization. ``But we shouldn't=
=20
be in this position in the first place. I think it's a shame we're even goi=
ng=20
to see a rate increase.''=20
Covering state's costs=20
Lynch said this rate increase, along with a statewide bond recently approve=
d=20
by lawmakers, should cover the state's costs in purchasing power.=20
But she left the door open for further rate increases, especially if energy=
=20
suppliers raise the price of electricity.=20
``If the sellers decide to turn up the heat and raise rates,'' she said,=20
``we'll have to look at those numbers again.''=20
Lynch and an administrative law judge both submitted similar plans. Because=
=20
Lynch is the commission president, her proposal would appear to be the most=
=20
likely to gain the support of fellow commissioners.=20
Industrial users appear to take the biggest hit under Lynch's plan. Those=
=20
equipped with special meters could see their rates double or more for power=
=20
they consume during peak demand periods. Small commercial users would pay=
=20
about 45 percent more for their ``on-peak'' electricity, Lynch said.=20
Lynch said she intentionally ``weighted'' the on-peak rates higher as a way=
=20
to encourage conservation.=20
``By promoting energy conservation during summer peak hours,'' she said in=
=20
her proposal, ``we attempt to limit blackouts and service interruptions in=
=20
order to preserve public health and safety.''=20
But industry representatives cried foul.=20
``These costs make it impossible to operate at a profit,'' said Jack Stewar=
t,=20
president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. ``You=
=20
can't add these kinds of prices to the product and try to sell it. This loo=
ks=20
like the beginning of the ringing of the death knell for the economy.''=20
Agriculture caps=20
For agricultural users, the proposals are a mixed bag. Agricultural groups=
=20
were hoping the PUC would endorse a recommendation by Gov. Gray Davis to ca=
p=20
their rate increases at 5 to 15 percent. Agriculture groups did get caps, b=
ut=20
they are higher than the governor's, ranging from 23 to 30 percent in both=

energy use.=20
``We are definitely going to be impacted significantly,'' said Michael=20
Boccadoro, executive director of the Agricultural Energy Consumers=20
Association.=20
Federal buildings=20
Lynch also slung an arrow at the federal government, proposing that federal=
=20
buildings in California be forced to pay market rates for electricity. Her=
=20
proposal that federal buildings be given real-time meters could drive up=20

Lynch is angry with the federal government's hands-off attitude toward the=

state's power crisis and its insistence that Californians pay market rates=
=20
for electricity.=20
Lynch's idea -- which she said would be studied in the coming weeks -- was=

derided by several critics.=20
``This is something you do in kindergarten,'' said fellow Commissioner=20

environmentally friendly power if major scientific hurdles can be overcome.=

Fusion is the way the sun and stars produce their energy. Unlike nuclear=20

Fusion energy has been proven possible in laboratories, but a power plant=

Fusion research funds, however, have decreased about 40 percent in the past=

Fusion requires intense heat and pressure. Under the proper conditions, lik=

The major source of fusion fuel is deuterium (heavy water), which is readil=

extracted from water. The other fuel source, tritium, is widely available=
=20
from seawater and land deposits.=20
Fusion is not to be confused with so-called ``cold fusion,'' a disputed=20
theory that few scientists believe is achievable. In 1989 two Utah scientis=

Task Force To Propose Legislation



By SCOTT LINDLAW
Associated Press Writer
WASHINGTON (AP) via NewsEdge Corporation  -
President Bush's energy task force plans to
propose legislation allowing the seizure of private property to
accelerate the construction of electrical power lines, three
administration officials said Tuesday.


The recommendation is contained in the final draft of a broad
energy blueprint to be unveiled by President Bush next week, the
officials said. The ``eminent domain'' authority allows the
government to appropriate private property for public use; the
property owners are usually compensated.


The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission already has eminent
domain authority over the siting of natural gas pipelines, but has
no such power over long-distance electricity transmission lines.
The lack of authority often requires electrical companies to get
approval from several states and numerous local jurisdictions.


Federal authority to locate transmission lines would quicken the
approval process, supporters of the provision contend. The shortage
of transmission lines has been cited by officials as one reason for
bottlenecks in the electric grids and a shortage of power in areas
of high demand.


New lines also are needed to connect new power plants to the
grid.


Vice President Dick Cheney said on CNN Tuesday that the energy
task force he heads will include a recommendation on eminent domain
for power lines.


``The issue is whether or not we should have the same authority
on electrical transmission lines'' as the government has on gas
lines, Cheney said. ``That's never been granted previously.''


He did not say what the recommendation would be.


But the administration officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the report would ask Energy Secretary Spencer
Abraham to draw up legislation allowing utilities to obtain rights
of way for transmission lines, presumably through FERC.


The energy strategy report is going to the printers in stages
this week. Officials said there was no talk of taking out the
eminent domain provision, though they could not rule out that
remote possibility.


Utilities, not the government, would own the property, one
official said.


Earlier this year, a draft of a Republican energy bill in the
Senate had included giving FERC eminent domain authority for power
lines. But that provision later was deleted when it was introduced
by Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska.


The electric utility industry for some time has been lobbying
for a federal role in siting electric power lines, which now must
go through a maze of overlapping local jurisdictions and state
agencies for approval.


``If FERC has the eminent siting authority, that will help
facilitate siting of electric power transmission lines,'' said Jim
Owen, a spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, which
represents investor-owned utilities.


It especially would help in getting interstate transmission
rights of way approved, he said.


``But it's still not a silver bullet because ... it can still be
a cumbersome process,'' said Owen. Some natural gas pipeline cases
before FERC have taken years to resolve, he said.


Critics have questioned whether Cheney's task force will
emphasize power production and transmission over conservation.


Cheney said the report would use tax breaks to encourage
conservation.


``Most of the financial incentives that we recommend in the
report go for conservation or renewables, for increased
efficiencies,'' Cheney said.


The task force will likely recommend tax incentives for purchase
of ``hybrid,'' ultra-efficient automobiles that run on gasoline and
electricity, one administration official said. A similar provision
was included in the budget Bush sent to Congress earlier this year.


The report will also call for a new tax credit for builders of
certain new power plants.


Cheney outlined the energy plan at the weekly Senate GOP
conference Tuesday.


According to one Republican who was present, the vice president
said that while he supported energy price controls when President
Nixon used them three decades ago, he wouldn't advocate them now.


Caps that are too high cause voters to blame politicians rather
than the utilities, Cheney said, according to the Republican.
Excessively low caps undermine the incentives for developing new
power sources, Cheney said.


After Cheney spoke, Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., rebutted, saying
he came from a state where energy prices have risen enormously in
the past year, and he favors price caps.





Stage 2 Electrical Emergency Declaration; SCE to Curtail 'Load' for Some=20
Customers



ROSEMEAD, Calif., May 9 /PRNewswire/  via NewsEdge Corporation  -
The California Independent System
Operator (Cal-ISO) again declared a Stage 2 Emergency this afternoon, due t=
o
low power reserves and increased demand for power because of high
temperatures.  The agency called upon Southern California Edison and other
investor-owned utilities to begin voluntary ""load"" curtailment programs for
certain customers within their service areas.


Cal-ISO said the Stage 2 Emergency would be in effect from 11:45 a.m.
through midnight.  Cal-ISO and SCE are making urgent appeals for all custom=
ers
to immediately reduce their electricity consumption so that reserve levels =
do
not deteriorate further.


To achieve this load reduction during Stage 2, SCE is required to activate
its voluntary load curtailment program, under which large industrial,
commercial, and agricultural customers have agreed to temporarily curtail
electricity usage during an electrical emergency in exchange for reduced
rates.


Should the situation worsen for any reason, and power reserves drop below
1.5%, Cal-ISO could declare a Stage 3 Emergency, the most critical status.
Cal-ISO could direct utilities to ""drop load,"" necessitating involuntary
rolling blackouts for groups of customers across their service areas until
sufficient reserve levels are achieved.


SCE customers are asked to reduce power consumption by turning off any
unneeded electrical appliances and lights, especially during the state's da=
ily
peak consumption period -- noon to 6 p.m.


Following are some effective ways customers can reduce their power use and
not be greatly inconvenienced:


LARGE ENERGY USERS


-- turn off all auxiliary or redundant machinery where possible;


-- consider shifting or staggering operations outside the hours of highest


electrical demand, typically noon to 6 p.m.;


AIR CONDITIONERS


-- set thermostats no lower than 78 degrees (F);


-- use electric fans instead of air conditioning if practical;


-- avoid using evaporative coolers or humidifiers at the same time an air


conditioner is running;


-- avoid cooling unoccupied rooms;


-- open windows during evening hours to take advantage of cool breezes;


APPLIANCES AND TOOLS


-- delay until evening hours the optional use of appliances (dishwashers,


clothes washers and dryers), chargers, power tools, and electrical


equipment;


REFRIGERATORS AND FREEZERS


-- avoid unnecessarily opening refrigerators;


-- keep your refrigerator or freezer set at the proper temperature;


-- be sure to use the ""power-saver"" switch if your refrigerator has one;


-- keep the condenser coils behind or beneath your refrigerator/freezer


clean (refrigerators represent approximately 25% of the electric bill


for a typical residence);


ADDITIONAL TIPS


-- run swimming pool equipment during early morning and evening hours;


-- limit the reopening of a refrigerator, which is a major user of


electricity in most homes;


-- use drapes and blinds to keep out direct sunlight;


-- replace incandescent light bulbs with ENERGY Star(R) qualified compact


fluorescent bulbs;


-- always wash a full load of clothes or use the variable water level


adjustment for smaller loads; and


-- be sure your home has adequate insulation.

Monday the California Public Utilities Commission faces a $4.8 billion=20

The right way to do that is to spread the higher electricity costs between=

But businesses shouldn't get saddled with some of the burden that belongs t=

A new law prohibits the PUC from increasing the rates on residential=20

This thankless task now falls to the PUC. Two proposals -- one by PUC=20

That's both unfair and bad for the economy. This burden belongs solely to t=

rides on assumptions that, if wrong, could lead to billions of dollars in=

runaway costs for taxpayers.

15 years.
?????If Davis and his cadre of financial advisors are right, the state will=

emerge from the most ominous period of the crisis in less than two years,=

flush with cash and the prospect of electricity rate cuts. By then, the hop=

goes, the power suppliers Davis has vilified will be reined in.
?????If his predictions are off by modest margins, which even many state=20

tactical blackouts to control costs, siphon money that could be used for=20
other services, go deeper in debt or raise electricity rates above the reco=
rd=20
increases of this year.
?????The governor's plan largely rests on these crucial assumptions: that=
=20
consumers will conserve a record amount of power at peak usage times, that=
=20
energy prices will drop precipitously, and that the state will lock in far=
=20
more contracts for long-term power. But those three assumptions could prove=
=20
faulty, according to government financial records and interviews with state=
=20
officials, Wall Street analysts and energy experts.
?????Davis is banking on that troika to quickly tame the wild prices of=20
last-minute power--which hit an apparent record of $2,000 for a megawatt-ho=
ur=20
Wednesday. Such purchases so far have put the state on the hook for $6=20
billion and pushed major utilities to the brink of ruin.
?????Davis' plan assumes that the state will reduce peak demand by 2,484=20
megawatts--enough to supply nearly 2 million homes--through three programs=
=20
run by the California Independent System Operator, which keeps power runnin=

?????But Cal-ISO managers say they will be lucky to achieve a fraction of=
=20
that savings this summer.
?????They say that one of the programs listed in the governor's plan was=20
shelved because regulators had raised concerns about air pollution. Another=
,=20
aimed at businesses, is likely to yield only about half of the 600 megawatt=
s=20
the governor has assumed will be saved when supplies are tight this summer,=
=20
said Cal-ISO Project Manager Bill Wagner.
?????""There's a lot of 'ifs' in there,"" he said of the conservation program=

which would pay businesses to cut back during critical hours. He said the=

utilities are months behind in installing meters to measure the savings.
?????Officials at another state agency in charge of a similar conservation=
=20
program, the Public Utilities Commission, also said they are not sure about=
=20
hitting targets on which the bond plan is based.
?????PUC Senior Analyst Robert Strauss said he has no idea how many=20
businesses will agree to curtail electricity consumption in exchange for=20
cheaper power rates this summer. The program is only a month old, he said.
?????""We're in a new situation that we don't have good experience with,""=20
Strauss said. ""Who's going to sign up for these programs? We don't really=
=20
know."" Another program that Davis hopes will conserve 1,600 megawatts has=
=20
attracted interest from just two businesses since March.
?????""It's pretty ambitious to think we're going to get 1,600 megawatts by=
=20
June in that program,"" said Cal-ISO's Wagner.
?????Beyond Davis' assumptions about conservation, the success of his=20
hard-fought bond measure relies heavily on how much the state will pay for=
=20
electricity during the next two summers. If the price is higher than foreca=
st=20
by Davis, the bond money could be consumed more quickly, potentially forcin=
g=20
the state to borrow more, dip into tax funds or raise customer rates again.
?????To keep prices down, the Davis administration has struggled to lock up=

avoid premium, eleventh-hour prices.
?????In his effort to push his bond legislation through the Capitol, he has=

suggested that about 50 such contracts will be signed to produce half of th=

peak demand the state needs. And that, his advisors say, doesn't count othe=
r=20
contracts they think will materialize.=20
?????So far, the administration has fallen far short, achieving final=20
agreements on only 28 contracts as of Thursday.
?????If that gap persists, the state will probably be forced to buy=20
electricity on the expensive spot market, which could eat into the bond mon=
ey.
?????""I think the operative word is uncertainty,"" said Paul Patterson, an=

energy analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. ""There are too many pieces,=

[and] all you need is for one or two of those not to work out substantially=

?????Patterson, who says he remains cautiously optimistic about the=20
governor's plan, was among a group of Wall Street analysts who were briefed=

last week by Davis' top advisors.
?????Some wondered about who would provide the additional power that Davis=

had incorporated into his plan. Others questioned whether investors would b=

?????During the briefing, the governor's advisors said one option being=20

?????In fact, as the debate over Bush's plan approaches, both sides are=20

virtually as much energy as they want--without sacrifice.
?????In a striking declaration earlier this week, White House spokesman Ari=

?????More surprising, environmentalists mobilizing to fight Bush's plan are=

?????This improbable consensus reflects a deeper political calculation=20

American life on almost every front--from energy to jobs to federal=20

?????The big question is whether either side's preferred solutions can=20
resolve the long-term energy problem without forcing Americans to face at=

?????Compared to most issues, public opinion about the energy debate is=20
unformed, analysts in both parties agree. That's largely because few=20
Americans have thought much about the problem since the last gas lines=20

Baldassare, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California.
?????As the struggle to shape public opinion begins, the central division i=

conservation as part of the solution, they portray it primarily as somethin=

done for consumers rather than by consumers.
?????White House aides say Bush isn't likely to completely ignore the value=

of vehicles with poor fuel efficiency. But overall both sides are promising=

minimal disruption--a stark contrast to the admission by California officia=

that higher prices are needed to deter electricity consumption.
?????Indeed, it's telling that, instead of discussing conservation, both Bu=

?????Behind those words, Carter offered an agenda bristling with thorny ide=

?????But Congress rejected almost all these ideas, focusing instead on tax=

?????Today strategists on both sides agree that the public is even less=20

?????In the immediate aftermath of the 1970s oil shocks, per capita U.S.=20

Restarting of Generators in O.C. Approved=20


By JENIFER WARREN, Times Staff Writer=20

?????SACRAMENTO--Granting the governor's wish that power plants receive=20
speedy approval, the California Energy Commission cleared the way Thursday=
=20
for the restarting of two idled generators that will double the output of a=
=20
plant in Huntington Beach.
?????The commission's action allows AES Corp. to run the two controversial=
=20
units for at least 10 years, provided that a midterm review finds that=20
operators are taking steps to limit any harm the plant may cause to seawate=
r=20
quality and marine life.
?????The commission also required the company to sell all the power generat=
ed=20
by the units, enough to supply about 337,500 homes, within California--a=20
restriction unprecedented in the state.
?????Some attorneys questioned whether the panel had the legal authority to=
=20
impose such a restriction. But Commissioner Robert Laurie said that althoug=
h=20
the limit ""may not be good long-term policy,"" the state's power emergency=
=20
warrants it now.
?????The commission's unanimous vote capped weeks of arduous negotiations=
=20
involving AES, the state and Huntington Beach officials, who called the=20
10-year permit ""a major disappointment."" AES officials pushed for the 10=20
years on grounds that a shorter time frame would make the economics of the=
=20
project iffy.
?????City officials preferred a five-year permit, saying the company's trac=
k=20
record--it once paid a $17-million fine for allowing too much pollution to=
=20
spew from its Long Beach plant--raises doubts about its future performance.=
=20
The commission's staff also favored five years, with the possibility of a=
=20
five-year extension.
?????""They have not exactly been great corporate citizens,"" Matt Lamb,=20
project manager for Huntington Beach, said of AES. ""This is a grossly=20
inefficient plant that has been mothballed, and they're basically=20
kick-starting it. We don't think it deserves 10 years.""
?????But Gov. Gray Davis--who has publicly pushed the commission to approve=
=20
plants quickly--hailed the decision. ""That's good news. That's supply we're=
=20
counting on,"" he said.
?????The two Huntington Beach units are 40 years old and have been idle sin=
ce=20
1995. But the energy crisis has made the old valuable once again, and AES=
=20
plans to invest $150 million to re-power the generators--once scheduled for=
=20
demolition.
?????The units represent almost 10% of the 5,000 megawatts Davis has said h=
e=20
will bring into service this summer to avert an electricity shortage.
?????Recent estimates, however, suggest that the governor's pledge was over=
ly=20
optimistic.
?????And although Davis and the Energy Commission are expecting the=20
Huntington Beach generators to begin operating in August, AES Southland=20
President Mark Woodruff said Thursday that it is unclear whether that goal=
=20
can be met.
?????The AES project is among a few receiving fast-track approval under the=
=20
governor's executive order earlier this year requiring expedited review of=
=20
such plants.
?????In normal times, a 450-megawatt project such as the one approved=20
Thursday might have taken a year's worth of study, public hearings and othe=
r=20
scrutiny, said Claudia Chandler, a commission spokeswoman. The expedited=20
review shrinks that to just 60 days.
?????That clearly rankles some Huntington Beach residents, who, in testimon=
y=20
before the commission, wondered whether emissions, ocean pollution and othe=
r=20
threats had been thoroughly studied.
?????""I think it's almost outrageous what's being foisted on the public,""=
=20
said Rich Lloyd, who lives about a quarter of a mile from the plant. ""What=
=20
relief are you going to give to all these people, all these schoolchildren,=
=20
who have to breathe these emissions for 10 years?""
?????Huntington Beach Councilwoman Shirley Dettloff said she too was troubl=
ed=20
by the fast-track licensing process: ""We're taking a risk as a city,"" she=
=20
said. ""If a price has to be paid, our citizens will be paying that price.""
?????Critics are alarmed by a UC Irvine study concluding that the=20
plant--which now uses and discharges about 300 million gallons of seawater=
=20
each day as coolant--may combine with ocean currents to attract sewage=20
released miles offshore.=20
?????Many residents suspect that the plant contributed to pollution that=20
caused repeated beach closures in 1999.
?????Acknowledging the concerns, the commission required AES to spend $1=20
million to study whether water quality is at risk.
?????The company also must spend $2.5 million to monitor fish deaths caused=
=20
by its seawater intake system. If too many white croaker, queenfish and oth=
er=20
species become trapped and die, AES may be required to modernize its=20
equipment, commission officials said.
?????Other complaints have focused on the noise, smoke and smells produced =
by=20
the plant.
?????Jane Riley, who lives nearby, plans her outings with son Daniel, 6,=20
around the thick clouds of yellow-brown smoke that are a part of everyday=

life.
?????""I try to avoid it. I take a look at which direction it's going,"" Rile=
y=20
said. With two more units fired up, a bad situation will only get worse, sh=

fears.
?????In other action Thursday, the commission approved a 95-megawatt ""peake=

plant in the Central Valley city of Hanford.

Discovery Has City Flying High=20
Energy: Claim of huge natural gas deposit leads Delano to dream of wealth=
=20
that may result. But some are skeptical.=20

By GEOFFREY MOHAN, Times Staff Writer=20

?????DELANO, Calif.--At the signal from oil wildcatter F. Lynn Blystone,=20
roughnecks opened the valve of a greasy well rig, and with an earsplitting=
=20
screech, a fat jet of natural gas blasted plumes of dust from the fields=20
outside this San Joaquin Valley town.
?????City officials covered their ears and dropped their jaws.
?????""That's the sound of money, loud and powerful,"" said Delano City Manag=
er=20
Adela Gonzalez.
?????Indeed, the estimated 3 trillion cubic feet of coveted and pricey=20
natural gas that Blystone, president and chief executive of Tri-Valley Corp=
.=20
in Bakersfield, claims to have tapped could be the biggest natural gas=20
discovery in California since the 1930s, and might rank among the top in th=
e=20
lower 48 states.
?????And although the full extent of the find remains unproven--and industr=
y=20
veterans urge caution--Blystone's well has set off a frenzy in this=20
impoverished agricultural town more famous for Cesar Chavez and the pickers=
=20
who touched off a national grape boycott.
?????Delano is seeing dollar signs in the dust. It's talking power plants,=
=20
pipelines, big industry, and independence from the grip of the statewide=20
energy crisis.
?????Energy consultants are lining up at City Hall, where visitors are urge=
d=20
to use the stairs instead of the elevators to save electricity. Ordinary=20
residents are scurrying to learn if they own mineral rights, mostly finding=
=20
that their dreams of overnight riches are about as real as the fictional=20
Clampett family on TV's ""The Beverly Hillbillies.""
?????""Everybody is doing their research, to see if they have mineral rights=
,""=20
said Delano Mayor Art Armendares. ""We're getting control of our own destiny=
.=20
We can provide citizens with uninterrupted electricity and gas. Then we can=
=20
put up our shingle and attract industry.""
?????Beyond grapes, almonds and other crops, industry is sparse in Delano,=
=20
which recently attracted a Sears distribution center for the West Coast.=20
Seasonal unemployment reaches upward of 30%, Armendares said.
?????Even if Delano is poised to reap rewards, the state in general won't s=
ee=20
much effect. That's because even the optimistic estimates of daily producti=
on=20
wouldn't meet more than 1% of the state's whopping 7.5 billion cubic-foot=
=20
demand, according to the state Department of Conservation.
?????That hasn't stopped Delano residents from dreaming. Among those who=20
might hit it big are City Manager Gonzalez's secretary, Phyllis Kraft, who=
=20
hails from one of the area's old farming families.
?????""People aren't exactly treating me differently, but they are saying,=
=20
'You're not going to forget me when you get rich and famous, are you?' "" sa=
id=20
Kraft, who remains cautiously optimistic about the claim. ""It would be=20
wonderful if it's true, but let's just wait and see.""
?????For years, children here have learned that, while the soil rendered=20
their food, its hidden riches could one day change their destiny. Few sold=
=20
their mineral rights, even when they let go of their land.
?????As a result, the original landowners are most likely to get any=20
royalties from leasing those rights--generally 12.5% to 25% of gross=20
production, Blystone said.
?????Revenue from the field could be $7 billion or more over a predicted=20
lifetime of 85 years, he said.
?????Among the biggest winners so far appears to be the U.S. government,=20
which operates an antenna field for the Voice of America on about 800 acres=
=20
of the 6,600 that Tri-Valley believes harbor natural gas.
?????But Emeterio ""Butch"" Navalta, who owns the plot where Tri-Valley=20
drilled, ignored the screech of the gas well Tuesday and sullenly hoed weed=
s=20
from his 20-acre plot. He bought the land for $60,000 last year but didn't=
=20
get the mineral rights. Although he gets $12,000 a year leasing drilling=20
space to Tri-Valley, he is bitter.
?????""I didn't even think about it,"" Navalta said. ""I'm trying to find=20
someone who knows what to do.""
?????Ruth Hiett, 85-year-old matriarch of a farming family with several=20
hundred acres in the claim area, said she'll hold tight to her rights.=20
Surrounded by almond trees and fallow fields, she lives in an aging clapboa=
rd=20
house that is part of the family's original 1906 homestead.
?????""I don't know if it'll make me rich, but it might somebody,"" Hiett sai=
d.=20
""Anybody who knows anything at all likes to think some day we'll hit it. Bu=
t=20
some company still has to come and explore and do whatever they have to do.=
=20
Who knows? No telling.""

?????'It's Just a Story as Far as I'm Concerned'
?????Thus far, no one knows, or no one is telling. But the prospect of 3=20
trillion cubic feet of unassociated, or ""dry,"" gas--meaning it is not mingl=
ed=20
with oil--in an area that has not shown such deposits before raises ample=
=20
skepticism.
?????""It's just a story as far as I'm concerned,"" said Lawrence Chroman Jr.=
,=20
a third-generation farmer who kept the mineral rights to the land he sold=
=20
Navalta last year. ""Whenever the price of gas or oil goes up, they have mon=
ey=20
to go out and do exploration. It goes through cycles. I'm not willing to go=
=20
any further until I see whether this thing develops or not.""
?????Experts and regulators likewise cautioned that one gushing well does n=
ot=20
prove a major find.
?????""All we can say is we are rooting for him,"" said Don Drysdale, spokesm=
an=20
for the state Conservation Department. ""It would help us all out. But the=
=20
statements they are making are based on one well. We don't know enough yet.=
""
?????Industry experts note that with natural gas going for $12 per thousand=
=20
cubic feet, plenty of wildcat drillers have been scouring overlooked or=20
unlikely places in search of El Dorado. Many find little more than, well,=
=20
Delano.
?????Tri-Valley, a public company whose stock trades at about $1.80, has be=
en=20
through bankruptcy protection before, fighting off a hostile takeover by a=
=20
creditor. And it has made one similar claim near Fresno, which proved dry.=
=20
When it announced the Delano find April 11, its stock leaped 75%, and has=
=20
since hovered just under $2.
?????The company will need about $100 million to drill about 40 wells that =
it=20
says could yield a total of 80 million cubic feet per day for about 85 year=
s.=20
That is well over the about 50 million cubic feet a day coming from the=20
state's most productive field, Rio Vista, according to the Conservation=20
Department, but still not enough to ease the state's crisis.
?????But because of the huge amount consumed daily in California, even if=
=20
optimistic estimates in Delano pan out, the production there won't help eas=
e=20
the state's crisis.
?????""We're not going to be able to materially affect the power needs of=20
California,"" Blystone cautioned.
?????Bolstering Blystone's claim is the East Lost Hills find reported in=20
February by Berkley Petroleum 25 miles west. That discovery has shown early=
=20
promise of being at least as big as the Delano find.
?????The two potential deposits were made public within six weeks of each=
=20
other, and nothing has been the same since in the area.
?????""There's almost been the equivalent of a Gold Rush to lease land all=
=20
around the Berkley field,"" Kramer said.
?????Drysdale said, however, that his department believes the two finds are=
=20
separate deposits.
?????Tri-Valley has mapped out 6,600 acres, and so far a substantial wedge=
=20
lies within Delano boundaries, where the city owns mineral rights.
?????Virtually everything is speculative about the claim, particularly=20
royalties. But city officials think they could make $3 million a year--in a=
=20
town with an operating budget of $6 million, dismally paved roads and=20
overcrowded schools.
?????Not only are they considering forming a municipal power authority, but=

they say they will waive about $1,000 in fees to landowners willing to anne=

?????""I'm going to make a one-time offer to all these farmers that the city=

will pick up the cost of annexation,"" said Matthew Alexander, community=20
development director for Delano. ""I see this as a window of opportunity.""
?????Alexander and others have been to Sacramento to study the pros and con=
s=20
of forming a municipal utility, and are convinced that building a power=20
plant, and using gas royalties to power it, is the answer.
?????""You're looking at a totally different town,"" Blystone said.
?????Small players like Navalta, however, suspect that Delano will be the=

Might Californians finally be seeing a dim light at the end of the energy=
=20
tunnel? This spring and summer will be difficult times unless everything=20
breaks just right. But Gov. Gray Davis' recently announced energy plan offe=
rs=20
at least short-run management of the crisis--and a hope for a long-run=20
solution. And that's about all anyone should ask the government to do.=20
Ignoring the history and some mind-numbingly complex details, the electrici=
ty=20
problem comes down to this: Demand now outstrips supply by a wide margin ev=
en=20
on a normal day, and by much more on days of peak demand. With the utilitie=
s=20
no longer credit-worthy, the state must fill the gap by buying on the=20
wholesale market. These days, that means buying high and selling low.
Any comprehensive attack on this problem must have three components:=20
mechanisms for reducing demand, mechanisms for increasing supply and a pile=
=20
of money to cover the bills while the medicine works. The governor's plan,=
=20
while not perfect, has the three elements. It also avoids the wackier=20
suggestions from both the right and the left.=20
Let's work backward through the three components. First, the state needs=20
money to keep the lights on. One naive remedy would be to raise taxes to pa=
y=20
all the bills. No danger that any politician will ever latch onto that one.=
=20
But a related bad idea--raising retail electricity rates to cover all the=
=20
costs--does have a following. Why is that a bad idea? Because the utilities=
=20
are saddled with debt from the past. And things almost certainly will be=20
brighter (pun intended) in the future.=20
Like a family, when a government is faced with a huge, one-time expense--sa=
y,=20
to build a highway--it generally borrows most of the money. That's sound=20
financial practice because it spreads what otherwise would be a ruinously=
=20
high cost over time. Davis wants to spread the cost of the current crisis b=
y=20
issuing bonds worth about $12 billion to $13 billion, secured by future=20
payments for electricity. I do not know whether this is exactly the right=
=20
number. But the principle is clear, and it's too bad the Legislature delaye=
d=20
the bond issue.=20
Next comes supply. Wishful thinkers on the right have a simple solution: Ju=
st=20
let retail prices rise, and more supply will come. The trouble is that it=
=20
won't, at least not in the short run. Over years, greater supply is the onl=
y=20
lasting solution. But to expect much supply response in the short run is=20
dreaming.=20
The left has its own favorite silly idea: The state should seize control of=
=20
power plants and take over the business of supplying electricity. Seize? Ho=
w=20
much good would that do to California's business climate? And does anyone=
=20
really believe that the state can, over the long run, generate and supply=
=20
electricity better than private business? There are, in fact, traces of=20
public ownership in the Davis plan: The state is buying transmission lines,=
=20
and a new public authority would build power plants if private industry fai=
ls=20
to do so. But the governor sees public ownership as a last, not a first,=20
resort.=20
Finally, we come to the demand side, where true believers offer the same=20
remedy: Just let the retail price rise enough to cut demand back to the=20
available supply. Sound harsh? It is. Higher electricity prices must be par=
t=20
of the solution, at least in the short run. But relying exclusively on high=
er=20
rates would be foolhardy and perhaps even ruinous to California's economy,=
=20
because titanic price hikes would be needed to cut demand by enough in shor=
t=20
order. So we would wind up inflicting pain on consumers without calling for=
th=20
greater generating or transmission capacity.=20
The governor at first resisted the conclusion that consumer prices had to=
=20
rise. But he has now embraced it. His package includes not just price hikes=
=20
for big energy users, but also financial incentives for those who reduce=20
consumption. More can be done in this regard, but he is at least on the rig=
ht=20
track.=20
Will these conservation measures get California through the next few months=
?=20
I wouldn't bet on it. But unless the federal government truly caps wholesal=
e=20
electricity prices temporarily, demand management is about the only short-r=
un=20
game in town.=20

Looming increases in California power bills may help replenish state coffer=

but will do little to promote conservation or reduce blackouts this summer,=
=20
consumer activists, environmentalists and PG&E said yesterday.=20
In a rare convergence of views, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. agreed with th=
e=20
utility's sharpest critics that the pending rate increases would be=20
insufficient to discourage electricity use.=20
While the heaviest residential power customers will see their June bills so=
ar=20
by as much as 40 percent, most increases will range between 7 and 15 percen=
t.=20
""Based on our studies, residential customers will not respond to changes in=
=20
price signals of less than 20 percent,"" said Michael Shames, executive=20
director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego.=20
""Forty percent is probably enough to send a signal,"" he added. ""A 15 percen=
t=20
increase is much less likely to have an impact.""=20
If so, this would undermine what state regulators say is a primary goal of=
=20
the rate increases, scheduled to be adopted Monday. Higher power bills, the=
y=20
say, will result in cutbacks in power usage.=20
""By promoting energy conservation during summer peak hours,"" said Loretta=
=20
Lynch, president of the Public Utilities Commission, ""we attempt to limit=
=20
blackouts and service interruptions in order to preserve public health and=
=20
safety.""=20
Gov. Gray Davis, who supports the plan to hand out rebates to those who can=
=20
reduce power use by at least 20 percent, also said higher rates would lead =
to=20
conservation.=20
""He thinks that if there's a financial incentive to conserve, then clearly=
=20
consumers will do it,"" said Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor.=
=20
'NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH'=20
The question now is whether the rate increases planned for customers of PG&=
E=20
and Southern California Edison will do the trick.=20
""They're not going to be enough,"" said Harry Snyder, senior advocate at=20
Consumers Union in San Francisco. ""This amount is not going to get us the=
=20
levels of conservation we need.""=20
Helen Burke, who oversees energy matters at the San Francisco Bay chapter o=
f=20
the Sierra Club, agreed that a long, hot summer of blackouts remained likel=
y.=20
""And if we get more blackouts, I'm sure the rates will have to be ratcheted=
=20
up again,"" she said.=20
A PUC overview of how much typical PG&E bills will rise in June supports th=
e=20
idea that the impact for most consumers will be minimal.=20
For example, a PG&E customer whose electricity usage is within 200 percent =
of=20
predetermined limits will see monthly bills rise 7 percent, from $95 to $10=
1.=20
A heavier user -- within 300 percent of ""baseline"" limits -- will see month=
ly=20
bills climb 15 percent, from $163 to $187.=20
The baseline usage figure -- included near the bottom of PG&E bills --=20
represents the minimal amount of power consumers require. It includes sever=
al=20
variables, such as climate and time of year.=20
Only the heaviest users -- surpassing 400 percent of baseline -- would=20
experience rate increases of as much as 40 percent.=20
State regulators say almost half of all residential utility customers stay=
=20
within 130 percent of baseline usage and thus would see no change in their=
=20
power bills.=20
In other words, the majority of residential customers eligible for higher=
=20
rates would see bills go up by no more than 15 percent.=20
John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman, acknowledged that this amount was unlikely t=
o=20
promote widespread cuts in electricity usage.=20
""Increases on the order of 7 to 15 percent probably won't accomplish much=
=20
conservation,"" he said.=20
""The only way you're going to see significant conservation this summer is a=
=20
combination of higher prices, giving people conservation tips, and raising=
=20
awareness among consumers that we're in a crisis,"" Nelson said.=20
Shames of the Utility Consumers' Action Network said state officials were=
=20
being less than honest when they insisted that the rate increases were mean=
t=20
first and foremost as a conservation tool.=20
""It's to recoup costs being incurred on the wholesale power market,"" Shames=
=20
said. ""That's it.""=20
California has spent more than $6 billion since January purchasing=20
electricity on behalf of cash-strapped utilities.=20
INCREASES TO GENERATE $5 BILLION
The pending rate increases will raise about $5 billion in additional=20
revenues, which will be merged with proceeds from a $13.4 billion bond=20
offering approved yesterday.=20
Yet even these sums represent only a fraction of the estimated $65 billion=
=20
California will spend on electricity this year.=20
""What we should be doing is raising rates a lot more,"" said Severin=20
Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institute in=20
Berkeley.=20
He advocated increasing power bills this summer by as much as 75 percent ov=

The owners of at least 19 small power plants scattered throughout Californi=
a=20
are now asking a bankruptcy judge -- along with state and federal power=20
regulators and lawmakers -- to set them free from their contracts with=20
bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric.=20
Attorneys for the so-called qualifying facilities said a new pricing system=
=20
recently ordered by the Public Utilities Commission lowers how much the QFs=
=20
can charge for their electricity. That means many actually lose money when=
=20
they run their plants because of soaring natural gas prices.=20
Those losses, as well as millions of dollars owed to all the state's roughl=
y=20
700 QFs for past deliveries, have forced many of those plants offline, QF=

or use natural gas to generate electricity, steam and other energy -- have=

benefitted from the contracts, which allowed them to charge higher prices f=
or=20
their electricity.=20
The qualifying facilities say that U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Dennis Monta=
li=20
should set them free from their contracts, allowing them to sell their=20
electricity on the wholesale market instead.=20
Critics fear that would allow the QFs to gouge California by matching high=

But representatives for four QFs from the Bakersfield area at a bankruptcy=

hearing Thursday pointed to this week's rolling blackouts as evidence the=
=20
state needs every megawatt it can get. And until they get paid a ""reasonabl=
e=20
rate,"" they can't afford to make electricity in California, they said.=20
""If we're paid a rate that doesn't cover our costs we will financially fail=
,""=20
said Bruce Leaverton, a lawyer representing the QFs.=20
Montali said he didn't think setting a new pricing system was within his jo=
b=20
description as a bankruptcy judge.=20
""Even though your side doesn't like the result, a lot of time and effort ha=
s=20
gone into this decision,"" Montali said. He gave both sides until May 24 to=
=20
debate before he makes his decision.=20
PG&E said Wednesday that only eight of the 300 QFs within its territory=20
remain offline for nonpayment reasons. Others are down for maintenance. The=

Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid, said onl=
y=20
1400 megawatts of QF power remain offline statewide. That's an improvement=
=20
over the 3,000 megawatts down last month.=20
The state receives about 6,000 megawatts of electricity from QF, according =

Republicans argue price caps would make the situation worse by discouraging=
=20
energy generators from providing power to the state.=20
The Democrats held an impromptu press conference in the hallway afterward,=

accusing the Republicans of abandoning their state in its darkest hour.=20
""This Republican-dominated committee said that California should drop dead,=

""I find it very surprising that people here in California experiencing this=

of the constituents of the state,"" Davis said at a press conference.=20
The Republicans argued the Democratic plan would have hurt California.=20
""The fact of the matter is, if you put price caps on, you create a better=

investment climate in Uganda than California,"" Radanovich said, ""and I won'=
t=20
vote for anything that'll keep us from solving our supply problem.""=20
Cox contended that price controls would do nothing to prevent blackouts=20
because they would not increase supply or reduce demand.=20
""In many ways this is for Californians simply changing the subject from our=

=20
that price controls will help us meet the blackout challenges.""=20
He also argued that because Feinstein's plan would exempt about half of=20

The state's top energy regulator says her proposal to force federal agencie=

""It's just saying, 'You weren't nice to us, so we're not going to be nice t=

Under her proposal, federal buildings, offices and military bases -- which=
=20
account for 1.5 percent of the state's energy load -- would pay rates based=
=20
on the fluctuating price of power on the wholesale market, probably leading=
=20
to huge increases at peak times.=20
Lynch said Wednesday the plan would force federal agencies to conserve=20
energy. She said the measure was not meant to punish the federal government=

for not intervening in California's energy crisis.=20
""It's just an experiment,"" she said.=20

Commissioner Jeff Brown, a Democrat, who backs the idea said yesterday. ""It=

Brown said federal officials had urged state regulators to raise rates,=20

Mary Filippini, western region spokeswoman for the General Services=20

State leaders consider scheduled power blackouts=20
Posted at 10:09 p.m. PDT Thursday, May 10, 2001=20
JOHN WOOLFOLK
State leaders are considering darkening sections of California on a rotatin=
g=20
schedule as one way to take the frustrating surprise out of the rolling=20
blackouts expected to be frequent this summer.=20
The proposal to turn off power to large sections of the state on a regular=
=20
basis rather than wait until the last minute to call a rolling blackout dre=
w=20
considerable interest among lawmakers. They met to consider the issue=20
Thursday, just days after outages swept the state with only minutes of=20
warning.=20
``We're talking about blackouts of such magnitude we just have to find a wa=
y=20
to get people better notified,'' said state Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Redondo=20
Beach. ``People want to know whether it's in our best interest to simply pl=
an=20
for outages, rather than subject ourselves to an out-of-control market. We=
=20
may be better off doing that.''=20
But while scheduling power outages would make blackouts more predictable, i=
t=20
may also make them more frequent than necessary. Customers might find=20
themselves in the dark even if plenty of power is available.=20
But the advantage of planned outages is that by lowering power demand, the=
=20
state could curb the runaway power prices draining its budget and ``break t=
he=20
back'' of the energy ``cartel,'' Bowen said.=20
Currently, the state pays whatever is necessary to keep the lights on.=20
Wednesday, state officials said they paid $1,900 a megawatt-hour to avoid=
=20
blackouts, the most they ever have spent.=20
Residents and businesses complain that rolling blackouts would be more=20
bearable with more warning.=20
``The overwhelming response from our constituents is, `We want=20
notification,'?'' said Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg, D-Los Angeles.=20
Businesses pay price=20
Carl Guardino, president of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group and a=20
board member of the California Independent System Operator, which runs most=
=20
of the power grid, said rolling blackouts have come with just two minutes'=
=20
warning. He's trying to get a notification plan in place for the summer tha=
t=20
would allow at least half an hour of notice.=20
``A two-minute warning may be appropriate for a football game, but it's=20
inadequate to protect California's citizens and economy,'' Guardino said.=
=20
With at least half an hour, businesses could fire up standby generators or=
=20
turn off computers, assembly lines and other equipment that could be damage=
d=20
by sudden blackouts, Guardino said. That could lessen the enormous costs of=
=20
the blackouts to businesses.=20
The manufacturing group estimated that the first wave of rolling blackouts,=
=20
which hit the Bay Area during a heat wave June 14, cost Silicon Valley=20
companies $100 million.=20
A month's worth of blackout days this summer -- a likely possibility -- cou=
ld=20
cost California $16 billion and 15,000 jobs, Guardino said, citing a Bay Ar=
ea=20
Economic Forum analysis.=20
Rolling blackouts, in which utilities cut power from one group of customers=
=20
to the next for an hour or so, are ordered when power demand threatens to=
=20
overwhelm available supplies and crash the whole system. It could take days=
=20
to restore power after a systemwide failure.=20
Summer is critical because air conditioning is California's biggest power=
=20
use. Grid managers expect the state to be short some 3,700 megawatts,=20
particularly in May and June, enough for more than 3 million homes. New pow=
er=20
plants may lessen the shortage in late summer, but hydroelectric power coul=
d=20
be more limited then.=20
Desert residents object=20
With rolling blackouts a virtual certainty, some lawmakers suggested planni=
ng=20
the entire summer's outages months in advance.=20
``I'm interested in calendar blackouts,'' said Assemblyman Mike Briggs,=20
R-Fresno. ``I'm talking about calendaring months in advance, `These are you=
r=20
potential blackout days.'?''=20
Under the current system, about half of all customers are exempt from rolli=
ng=20
blackouts because they are essential services like police or hospitals or=
=20
share a circuit with them. The rest are divided among outage groups or bloc=
ks=20
spread throughout each utility's service area, a move intended to prevent=
=20
blackouts from affecting any region disproportionately.=20
Officials from desert districts oppose planning to turn off power in their=
=20
areas. But they suggested reconfiguring circuits so cool coastal areas coul=
d=20
go dark while hot regions are spared.=20
``If you want to black out other parts of the state, that's OK by me,'' sai=
d=20
Sen. Jim Battin, R-Palm Desert, adding that his desert constituents have pa=
id=20
taxes to help coastal residents through earthquakes and mudslides. ``Now it=
's=20
our turn.''=20
The current system for dealing with power shortages was established under t=
he=20
state's 1996 deregulation plan, with three stages of emergencies declared a=
s=20
demand approaches the limits of supply.=20
During Stage 2 emergencies, utilities cut off businesses that have agreed t=
o=20
lose power in exchange for lower rates. Stage 3 emergencies indicate rollin=
g=20
blackouts are possible.=20
But state officials never expected to put such measures in place regularly,=
=20
and the system's flaws have become evident over the past year.=20
Grid officials avoid making outage predictions because they fight for every=
=20
last watt, said Terry Winter, the system operator president.=20
The system operator faces shortages each morning of anywhere from 7,000 to=
=20
16,000 megawatts, differences usually made up throughout the day by=20
conditions that change by the minute, Winter said.=20
Planning outages around the state could work, Winter said. But he cautioned=
=20
that transmission constraints, sudden plant outages and weather could still=
=20
mean unexpected outages.=20
Lawmakers said even a vague prediction, like a weather forecast, would be=

Attorneys for the so-called qualifying facilities said a new pricing system=

they run their plants because of soaring natural gas prices.=20
Those losses, as well as millions of dollars owed to all the state's roughl=

The qualifying facilities say that U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Dennis Monta=

Failure to conserve fueled energy woes=20

that they weren't needed. In fact, right up until last year oil refining wa=

Here's what happened: In the wake of the energy crisis in the 1970s, ordina=
ry=20
people in the United States began conserving energy -- not as a ``sign of=
=20
personal virtue,'' as Cheney sneeringly puts it, but because they wanted to=

,=20
the oil industry was subject to ``refinery creep,'' the tendency of refinin=

capacity to grow through incremental improvements even when no new refineri=

=20
the late 1990s.=20
What finally brought us up against capacity constraints was a surge in dema=

that was partly due to the economic boom of the later Clinton years, but=20
mainly due to the renewed enthusiasm of Americans for huge, gas-guzzling=20
vehicles -- an enthusiasm, er, fueled by cheap gas. In 1998 gasoline was=20
cheaper compared with overall consumer prices than ever before in U.S.=20
history -- 60 percent cheaper than it was in 1981. The nation rushed out to=

from building new facilities; they were simply caught by surprise.=20

PG&E Files Opposition to Ratepayers' Committee



SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 9, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -
Pacific Gas and
Electric Company today filed a motion with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
asking the court to vacate the United States Trustee's (UST)
appointment of the Ratepayers' Committee. The filing indicates that
the creation of a Ratepayers' Committee exceeded the authority of the
UST because it was inconsistent with express provisions of the federal
Bankruptcy Code.


Pacific Gas and Electric Company appreciates that its Chapter 11
filing and Plan of Reorganization may create concerns for the
company's customers. Under the Bankruptcy Code, there are legitimate
ways by which the ratepayers can be represented and heard in the
process, for example, through the California Attorney General's
Office. In addition, the bankruptcy code provides flexibility and
discretion to the court to allow parties to intervene in the case when
they have standing to do so.


The utility does not object to ratepayers having a voice in the
process, when issues arise where the court determines they have
standing, but does object to procedures that are outside of the
existing Bankruptcy Code.


In its filing, Pacific Gas and Electric Company says the
""organizations and individuals appointed to the Ratepayers' Committee
-- and the ratepayers whose interests they supposedly represent -- are
neither creditors nor equity security holders and therefore not
eligible for appointment to a committee by the UST under Section
1102(a)(1). Thus, the UST's appointment of the Ratepayers' Committee
was not authorized by the Bankruptcy Code and constitutes an abuse of
discretion by the UST.""

SCE to Curtail 'Load' for Some Customers Following Stage 2 Electrical=20
Emergency Declaration



ROSEMEAD, Calif., May 10 /PRNewswire/  via NewsEdge Corporation  -
The California Independent System
Operator (Cal-ISO) again declared a Stage 2 Emergency this afternoon due to
low power reserves and increased demand for power because of high
temperatures.  The agency called upon Southern California Edison and other
investor-owned utilities to begin voluntary ""load"" curtailment programs for
certain customers within their service areas.


Cal-ISO said the Stage 2 Emergency would be in effect from 1 p.m. through
midnight.  Cal-ISO and SCE are making urgent appeals for all customers to
immediately reduce their electricity consumption so that reserve levels do =
not
deteriorate further.


To achieve this load reduction, at 1:48 p.m. SCE activated its voluntary
load curtailment program, under which large industrial, commercial, and
agricultural customers have agreed to temporarily curtail electricity usage
during an electrical emergency in exchange for reduced rates.


Should the situation worsen for any reason, and power reserves drop below
1.5%, Cal-ISO could declare a Stage 3 Emergency, the most critical status.
Cal-ISO could direct utilities to ""drop load,"" necessitating involuntary
rolling blackouts for groups of customers across their service areas until
sufficient reserve levels are achieved.


SCE customers are asked to reduce power consumption by turning off any
unneeded electrical appliances and lights, especially during the state's da=
ily
peak consumption period -- noon to 6 p.m.


Following are some effective ways customers can reduce their power use and
not be greatly inconvenienced:


LARGE ENERGY USERS


-- turn off all auxiliary or redundant machinery where possible;


-- consider shifting or staggering operations outside the hours of


highest electrical demand, typically noon to 6 p.m.;


AIR CONDITIONERS


-- set thermostats no lower than 78 degrees (F);


-- use electric fans instead of air conditioning if practical;


-- avoid using evaporative coolers or humidifiers at the same time an


air conditioner is running;


-- avoid cooling unoccupied rooms;


-- open windows during evening hours to take advantage of cool breezes;


APPLIANCES AND TOOLS


-- delay until evening hours the optional use of appliances


(dishwashers, clothes washers and dryers), chargers, power tools, and


electrical equipment;


REFRIGERATORS AND FREEZERS


-- avoid unnecessarily opening refrigerators;


-- keep your refrigerator or freezer set at the proper temperature;


-- be sure to use the ""power-saver"" switch if your refrigerator has one;


-- keep the condenser coils behind or beneath your refrigerator/freezer


clean (refrigerators represent approximately 25% of the electric bill


for a typical residence);


ADDITIONAL TIPS


-- run swimming pool equipment during early morning and evening hours;


-- limit the reopening of a refrigerator, which is a major user of


electricity in most homes;


-- use drapes and blinds to keep out direct sunlight;


-- replace incandescent light bulbs with ENERGY Star(R) qualified


compact fluorescent bulbs;


-- always wash a full load of clothes or use the variable water level


adjustment for smaller loads; and


-- be sure your home has adequate insulation.

Associated Press Writer=3D


SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Ray Marquez wonders whether he'll have to cut
back on food or gas in order to pay his electricity bill.


The 34-year-old Orange County maintenance man usually pays dlrs
80 a month for power during summer months. Now, he's trying to
figure out how to pay an electricity bill that could push dlrs 130
come June 1.


``Since I got married and had children, you know, I've been
dealing with balancing bills,'' he said Wednesday. ``But if I now
have to pay more for electricity, I'm not going to have money for
gas or food for the kids.''


As Californians coped with rolling blackouts that darkened
thousands of businesses and homes Monday and Tuesday, many
struggled with an even bigger worry: how to pay for soaring energy
costs.


In March, the state Public Utilities Commission approved the
biggest rate increase in California history, up to 46 percent for
customers of Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric.
Those rate hikes start hitting customers in next month's bill.


Gailen Kyle, who raises alfalfa on 1,600 acres (640 hectares) in
the Mojave Desert, says a 40 percent increase would put his farm
out of business.


``It would end us,'' the third-generation farmer said.
``Everybody here that farms alfalfa would be out of business.''


Kyle, 46, said he has to pump water nearly around the clock from
wells drilled 310 feet (93 meters) below his farm near Lancaster. A
small increase in the price of energy a few months ago added dlrs
80,000 to the dlrs 400,000 annual bill he was already paying.


To save money, Kyle agreed to become an ``interruptible''
customer, meaning he voluntarily allows his power to be shut off
during statewide electricity shortages in exchange for reduced
rates. So far this year, his power has been cut 26 times.


Even before the state utilities commission raised rates,
residents were paying 26 percent more for electricity than the
nationwide average, according to federal statistics. Only customers
in New England, New York, Alaska and Hawaii pay more.


One of the problems is that the wholesale cost of electricity
has risen sharply over the past year but under California's 1996
deregulation law the state's largest utilities, PG&amp;E and SoCal
Edison, have been prevented from passing their costs to customers.
In April, PG&amp;E declared bankruptcy.


The West isn't just facing spiraling costs and a shortage of
supplies, however. Its transmission system is fragmented and
overworked and would take years to improve, power officials told
the region's governors Wednesday.


``There is no immediate solution,'' said Idaho Gov. Dirk
Kempthorne, one of four governors participating in a six-hour,
round-table meeting with industry representatives.


The Western Governors Association was told there is no
established method for paying for transmission upgrades, and market
and regulatory barriers stand in the way. It's not even clear where
new power lines are most needed.


The group, which included the governors of Utah, Idaho, Montana
and Wyoming, has given energy experts until July 15 to recommend
ways to eliminate bottlenecks.


Meanwhile Californians, who've already weathered six days of
rolling blackouts this year, fear they'll soon be paying more for
less service.


The Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power
grid, has forecast more than 30 days of blackouts this summer due
to severe shortages of electric supply.


Dee Ann Hendirx, 53, of San Francisco, has stocked up on candles
and battery-operated clocks.


``I hate to say this but it's getting to be a way of life in
California,'' she said.

Fortunes hang on the new process. Geologists figure that mining just 15=20

bonanza.=20
Not only that, but hundreds of new power plants planned across the nation,=

prices near an all-time high, the hunt for coal-bed methane also rages in=
=20
Colorado and New Mexico.=20
More than 8,600 wells have been drilled in the river basin, with thousands=

more planned. About 80 coal-bed methane companies operate in the region.=20
Many of the companies report fat profits, and some of the nation's largest=

The state of Wyoming last year projected a $183 million deficit. Now it's=

California's surplus has shriveled in recent months because of the energy=

Wyoming Gov. Jim Geringer recently told Congress that his state's energy=20

This is Dick Cheney country to boot. The vice president is from Wyoming. As=
 a=20
young man, he worked in the backcountry, erecting power lines.=20
Now Cheney chairs President Bush's energy task force. The panel will make=

long-range recommendations this week for solving the energy crunch.=20
Critics complain that Bush, a former oilman, is too cozy with the energy=20
industry. Others welcome him, dismissing President Clinton as a tree-hugger=
.=20
Wyoming has a history of mining booms, in oil and coal.=20
But this boom, nervous ranchers say, is radically different.=20

??
To get the gas out, miners must draw water from the coal beds. Each well=20
produces about 12,000 gallons of water a day, much of it high in salt.=20
The impact can be jarring. This spring, runoff water from neighboring wells=
=20
flooded William West's ranch, killing creekside Cottonwoods and about 100=
=20
acres of hay. Some of the ground sits bare and bleached.=20
""We're extremely worried,"" says his wife, Marge West. ""This water is going =
to=20
kill the land.""=20
Gary Beach, Wyoming's chief of water quality, says the salty water tends to=
=20
destroy the soil's chemical structure. ""It starves plants for water,"" he=20
says.=20
Rancher Ed Swartz says that is what's happening at his homestead. ""It just=
=20
makes you sick,"" he says.=20
But coal-bed companies say they often work with landowners to soften the=20
impact. Some pipe the water into man-made ponds. Others inject it back into=

the earth.=20
Some ranchers and others welcome the water, saying cattle and other livesto=
ck=20
depend on it.=20
""Ninety-five percent of the people around here are tickled to death with=20
this,"" says John Kennedy, president of Gillette-based Kennedy Oil.=20
Many Wyoming conservationists, however, consider methane mining and the wat=
er=20
byproducts the biggest environmental threats to the state in decades.=20
They don't want to kill the boom, but believe businesses and government are=
=20
failing to address the hard questions because they're blinded by the bottom=
=20
line.=20
In neighboring Montana, officials have placed a moratorium on methane wells=
=20
so they can study the risks. Wyoming law doesn't require a similar review.=
=20
The boom comes as the demand for natural gas balloons nationwide. Boosting=
=20
domestic energy production is also a central plank of the Bush=20
administration.=20
There's talk of developing a pipeline to send the Wyoming gas directly to=
=20
California's Central Valley, where several new power plants are planned.=20
Swartz groans at the idea.=20
""I don't see why I should have to sacrifice my ranch to help bail you out o=
f=20
a crisis.""=20

??
As a boy, William West rode Shetland ponies on the plains for hours.=20
It was the 1940s. The West homestead, staked out by his father in 1919,=20
didn't have electricity or telephones.=20
Those are West's earliest memories as he sits in his ranch house, eating=20
lunch. Today it's spinach, canned ham, cookies and milk.=20
He wears dirty jeans and black boots. His hair is wispy and gray.=20
His is the life of an American original, the Wyoming homesteader. He keeps=
=20
600 head of cattle and grows alfalfa and wheat. While he's never made a min=
t=20

He drives a mud-caked, 1975 Dodge Ram truck.=20
But when he drives it now, he turns glum. All this runoff water. All these=
=20
power poles on his once-bare land. All these miners he hardly knows.=20
""Had we realized there would be these (consequences), we would not have=20
signed a drilling contract so willingly,"" he says.=20
For their troubles, the Wests receive $10,000 royalty checks about every=20
three months from a drilling outfit. Sweet money after a hardscrabble life.=
=20
But even to some supporters of methane mining, that's not much, considering=

how it's upending ranch life.=20
""This was a land of solitude. Now there's somebody everywhere you look,"" sa=

Summer blackout forecasts still hazy=20




By Karen Kucher=20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20
May 13, 2001=20
This promises to be a summer of uncertainty.=20
Rolling blackouts pummeled the state twice last week when grid managers cam=
e=20
up short on energy supplies, and power was cut off to thousands of business=
es=20
and residents.=20
With summer near, everyone is wondering how regular this routine will becom=
e.=20
But there are no clear answers.=20
""It is going to be a great soap opera,"" said consumer advocate Michael=20
Shames. ""We are calling this 'our summer of disconnect.'?""=20
Predictions abound. One often-repeated estimate is that the lights will go=
=20
out on 30 to 35 days, an educated guess based on last year's consumption=20
levels. One local fire chief said he had heard that blackouts would hit two=
=20
to three days a week.=20
But the agency that manages the state's electricity grid has issued no such=
=20
estimates.=20
Lorie O'Donley, a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operato=
r,=20
said blackout predictions are springing up like urban myths, taking on the=
=20
ring of truth with repetition.=20
The real truth, she said, is that no one can say how often the lights will =
go=20
out or for how long. It depends on the weather, the daily fluctuations in t=
he=20
wholesale electricity market, how much conservation takes place and whether=
=20
power plants run steadily or suffer mechanical breakdowns.=20
""You can understand the dynamics here,"" O'Donley said. ""We have to play the=
=20
cards we are dealt that day, and we will definitely do the best to locate=
=20
enough resources and try, but it is going to be a challenge.""=20
Grid managers say blackouts are possible on days when consumption exceeds=
=20
40,000 megawatts. The state exceeded that level on 34 days last summer.=20
But that measuring stick isn't a strict standard.=20
Just this past week, blackouts were ordered on two days when peak usage was=
=20
about 34,000 megawatts. Enough power couldn't be bought to meet demand, and=
=20
about one-third of the state's generating capacity was unavailable because =
of=20
breakdowns or planned maintenance.=20
California got into this crisis after its 1996 deregulation plan went=20
terribly wrong. The wholesale price of power skyrocketed, and=20
electricity-generating capacity suddenly was inadequate to meet growing=20
demand.=20
Critics of deregulation say electricity suppliers, who have posted huge=20
corporate profits from the higher electricity prices, manipulated the marke=
t=20
and made the supply situation worse.=20
Power suppliers say California, which did not build any new generating plan=
ts=20
in a dozen years, simply does not have enough supply, a situation they say =
is=20
worsened by a reduction in the availability of hydroelectric power from the=
=20
Pacific Northwest. The suppliers also say increased demands on California's=
=20
aging system of power plants are responsible for the historically high leve=
l=20
of facility outages.=20
Shames, who heads the Utility Consumers' Action Network, said he expects=20
power emergencies to be declared all summer long.=20
It wasn't a good sign that just a few days of warm weather pushed the state=
=20
beyond its tight energy supplies, he said, adding: ""It is pretty clear to m=
e=20
that we are going to see through May, June, July and probably into August=
=20
almost continual Stage 2 situations. So much of this depends on Mother=20
Nature.""=20
On that front, weather forecasters say not to expect any miracles.=20
A statewide 90-day forecast for California says June, July and August shoul=
d=20
hit normal summer temperatures.=20
Imperial County, eastern Riverside and eastern San Bernardino counties are=
=20
expected to average about half a degree above normal. The average in San=20
Diego and Los Angeles counties and in western Riverside and western San=20
Bernardino counties will be about two-tenths of a degree above normal.=20
While those changes are significant for meteorologists, they probably won't=
=20
make much of a difference for most state residents.=20
""You won't be able to feel the difference,"" said Philip Gonsalves, a=20
meteorologist intern for the National Weather Service. ""If you normally set=
=20
your thermostat to 72 degrees and you set it at 74, that's a bigger=20
difference than what we are anticipating.""=20
The ISO has predicted California will be short nearly 3,700 megawatts next=
=20
month, enough to provide power to more than 2.7 million homes.=20
Gov. Gray Davis had hoped to have 5,000 additional megawatts online by July=
=20
to help meet that shortfall, but many of those plants have been delayed.=20
The California Energy Commission says 2,100 megawatts of new power generati=
on=20
is expected to be online by July, far less than what state officials had=20
wanted. By September, about 5,200 megawatts should be operational.=20
""We are doing everything we can to get new generation online,"" said Claudia=
=20
Chandler, assistant executive director of the commission, which approves ne=
w=20
power plants in the state. ""It is disappointing to us that all of them won'=
t=20
be available earlier in the summer.""=20
Chandler said there have been delays in getting emergency peaking facilitie=
s=20
built. Peaker plants are small, relatively inefficient plants used only=20
during periods of high electricity demand.=20
""Those applications just didn't come in as early as we needed,"" Chandler=20
said. ""It took a while before we saw the first peaker application come into=
=20
the process. .?.?. The good news is we are going to have a problem next=20
summer, too, and all this generation will be ready for next summer's demand=
.""=20
Uncertainty about the electricity market has people rearranging the way the=

The skyrocketing price of natural gas has been felt by many ratepayers in=

Communities Fighting $270-Million Power Line=20


By SCOTT GOLD, Times Staff Writer=20

?????ROMOLAND, Calif.--It has all the trappings of a parochial,=20
not-in-my-backyard brouhaha: anxiety over property values, the environment=
=20
and local business.
?????But the subject of this particular debate--a proposed $270-million=20
electricity transmission line starting in this scrubby outpost of chicken=
=20
wire, strip mall churches and tumbleweeds--has ominous implications for all=
=20
of California.
?????Effectively using California's energy crisis as ammunition, San Diego=
=20
Gas & Electric Co. wants to build the 500,000-volt line through 31 miles of=
=20
bluffs, parks, wilderness and neighborhoods in southwest Riverside County.
?????That has prompted a boisterous response from area residents, who have=
=20
countered with door-to-door campaigns and picket lines--and challenged the=
=20
very notion, an article of faith in the energy industry, that additional=20
power lines are needed to dig the state out of its energy crisis.
?????""We're not human beings to them,"" said Loma Bosinger, co-chairwoman of=
=20
Save Southwest Riverside County, formed in response to the SDG&E proposal.=
=20
""We're nuisances. We're red tape.""
?????SDG&E and other energy companies say that although the lack of=20
generators in California is the most pressing component of the crisis, a la=
ck=20
of power transmission lines also is a key contributor. During the state's=
=20
first round of rolling blackouts in January, Northern and Central Californi=
a=20
suffered largely because of a transmission bottleneck in the Central Valley=
.
?????The gaps in generation and transmission mean that California's=20
once-sturdy energy grid has become a fussy, delicate contraption, said Jim=
=20
Avery, SDG&E's senior vice president of fuel and power operations.
?????""If one part gets out of balance, it can take down the whole system,""=
=20
Avery said.
?????Neighborhoods along the proposed route of the so-called Valley Rainbow=
=20
Interconnect, through dusty Hemet and the wine country of Temecula, aren't=
=20
convinced that California's situation is quite so dire.
?????They point out that SDG&E first pitched the line last summer by saying=
=20
that it was needed to provide power to the San Diego area--because state=20
energy officials believe that demand in the region will begin exceeding=20
current deliveries in 2004, which would mean blackouts. More recently,=20
though, SDG&E has begun pitching the new transmission line as a system to=
=20
export electricity from new generators in the San Diego area to the rest of=
=20
the state power grid.
?????SDG&E insists that those two arguments do not conflict. But residents=
=20
have found the company's position disingenuous at best. And what seemed a=
=20
neighborhood tiff has become something more, widely seen as a harbinger of=
=20
scuffles to come as California confronts its power crisis.
?????The state already has 26,000 miles of electric transmission lines. And=
=20
in the next four years--according to the California Independent System=20
Operator, the agency that oversees the state grid--74 transmission-line=20
construction projects are expected so energy companies can meet state and=
=20
federal reliability standards.
?????More lines will be added purely for economic gain, said Armando Perez,=
=20
director of grid planning for Cal-ISO, and similar battles are expected to=
=20
dog many of those proposals.
?????""There has always been, and always will be, a tension between the=20
proponents' need for lines and locating it so it doesn't have a terrible=20
impact on neighboring communities,"" said Mark Mihaly, a San Francisco lawye=
r=20
who will represent residents in upcoming hearings about the placement of th=
e=20
transmission line.
?????""But what you will see is that the power companies are going to be usi=
ng=20
the energy crisis, trying to hitch their wagon to that train. You'll see it=
=20
again and again.""
?????In coming months, politics may further complicate the debate.
?????In Washington, the task force developing a national energy=20
strategy--headed by Vice President Dick Cheney--is reportedly weighing a mo=
ve=20
to give federal authorities the power of eminent domain to acquire private=
=20
land for new electrical transmission lines.
?????And in Sacramento, Assemblyman Dennis Hollingsworth (R-Murrieta) has=
=20
proposed a bill that would require state energy officials and utilities to=
=20
use public land for transmission lines before they would be allowed to=20
acquire private property. That bill, which awaits votes in two Assembly=20
committees in coming weeks, targets not only future transmission lines but=
=20
the proposed line in southern Riverside County, Hollingsworth said.
?????""I object to the fact that private property is looked at as the path o=
f=20
least resistance,"" he said.
?????In Riverside County, community leaders say they have a series of=20
concerns about the SDG&E proposal. Some are worried that the line will mar=
=20
the picturesque bluffs of the region, which could in turn hurt its ability =
to=20
draw tourists, wine lovers and nature lovers. That could drive down propert=
y=20
values, they fear. Others are concerned about local businesses, from golf=
=20
courses that are close to the proposed route of the transmission system to=
=20
hot-air balloon companies that would have to steer clear of high-voltage=20
lines.
?????In Hemet, residents are enraged that the transmission line apparently=

will cut through parkland near the new Diamond Valley Lake reservoir. A=20
series of parks and nature preserves were supposed to be Hemet's ""payment,""=
=20
of sorts, for welcoming the $2-billion reservoir, the largest in Southern=
=20
California. Now, many--including Metropolitan Water District officials--are=

afraid that the proposed lines could cleave those areas in two.
?????This kind of debate will become increasingly common, said Severin=20
Borenstein, a business professor at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business a=

?????""There is a tremendous need for transmission,"" Borenstein said. ""This =

Bush Tax Incentives Fuel Plan on Energy=20
Power: President=01,s 'new kind of conservation' also promotes efficient=20

=20
heavily on oil, gas.=20

By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer=20

?????WASHINGTON--President Bush on Saturday called for a ""new kind of=20
conservation"" that saves power through tax incentives and energy-efficient=
=20
technology, signaling a shift in tone as he prepares to unveil his long-ran=
ge=20
energy policy.
?????Bush=01,s focus on conservation in his weekly radio address follows=20
criticism that he and Vice President Dick Cheney have been drafting a plan=
=20
that is heavily weighted toward more oil and gas drilling while giving shor=
t=20
shrift to other approaches to the energy problem.
?????In a clear response to such attacks, Bush pledged that conservation=20
would be a major element of his plan, to be released Thursday at an=20
energy-efficient power plant in St. Paul, Minn.
?????Previewing some of his policy=01,s details, Bush proposed tax credits =
for=20
the purchase of gas-electric cars and expansion of a government program tha=
t=20
promotes energy efficiency in buildings and products.
?????However, rather than call for Americans to sacrifice, as President=20
Carter did during the energy crisis of the 1970s, Bush said, ""Some think=20
conservation means doing without. That does not have to be the case.""
?????Conservation, he said, can be achieved through technological innovatio=
n,=20
such as building sensors into buildings to shut off lights as soon as peopl=
e=20
leave the room.
?????""Over the long term, the most effective way to conserve energy is by=
=20
using energy more efficiently,"" Bush said. ""Pushing conservation forward wi=

administration=01,s energy plan.""
?????Bush=01,s stress on conservation seemed to contrast with recent commen=
ts by=20
Cheney, who has been in charge of drafting the energy policy. In a recent=
=20
speech, Cheney said, ""Conservation may be a sign of personal virtue, but it=
=20
is not a sufficient basis for a sound, comprehensive energy policy.""
?????Energy conservation advocates, although welcoming Bush=01,s comments, =
noted=20
that the administration has adopted less stringent energy-efficiency=20
standards for home central air conditioners than those advocated by the=20
Clinton administration. The Bush administration contended that the standard=
s=20
proposed by Clinton set too high a burden on consumers.
?????David M. Nemtzow, president of the Alliance to Save Energy, a=20
Washington-based coalition of business, consumer, government and=20
environmental leaders, called Bush=01,s emphasis on conservation a ""great=
=20
start,"" and he said it reflected a ""change in tone from where [the=20
administration] has been in the past.""
?????However, Nemtzow added, ""There needs to be a lot more.""
?????Bush, who has been criticized by California officials for not doing mo=
re=20
to address the state=01,s electricity crisis, said he is ""very concerned"" a=
bout=20
the possibility of continuing blackouts in California this year.
?????He noted that federal facilities in California have been ordered to cu=

peak electricity use--including setting thermostats at 78 degrees and turni=

off escalators during power emergencies--and military bases in the state wi=
ll=20
reduce peak-hour use by 10%.
?????""These are immediate measures to help with an immediate problem,"" Bush=
=20
said.=20
?????But Gov. Gray Davis, reacting to Bush=01,s address, assailed the White=
=20
House for refusing to back firm price controls on wholesale electricity=20
supplies. Bush contends that price controls will discourage energy companie=
s=20
from building power plants.
?????California last week had to pay $2,000 a megawatt hour for electricity=
,=20
up from $30 a year earlier, Davis said in a statement. The power supplier, =
he=20
noted, was a Texas energy company.
?????""I hope that President Bush and I can agree that any worthy energy=20
policy must address the price gouging of consumers by greedy energy=20
suppliers, particularly in states like California that are working valiantl=
y=20
to bring additional supply online,"" Davis said.
?????Based on details that have emerged in recent days, Bush=01,s energy=20

o=20
oil and gas exploration, encouraging development of more nuclear power,=20
streamlining the approval process for building new power plants and giving=

?????On the conservation front, the plan will include:=20
?????* Tax incentives to encourage businesses to use more energy-efficient=
=20
power plants;
?????* Tax credits for purchase of high-mileage, low-emission ""hybrid""=20
vehicles that use electronics and fuel cells to significantly improve their=
=20
gasoline mileage. Bush, in his remarks Saturday, did not specify an amount.=
=20
Bipartisan legislation introduced in Congress would provide a tax credit of=

While some of California's biggest energy users cut their power last week t=
o=20
keep the lights on in the rest of the state, the program that provides that=
=20
emergency help is almost out of business.=20
Most of the state's 1,600 or so ""interruptible customers,"" who agree to=20
short-notice power cuts in return for lower energy costs, were asked to shu=
t=20
down four times last week as demand for electricity rose in the hot weather=
=20
and supply was constricted by planned and unplanned generator shutdowns.=20
But there are strict limits on how often those customers can be turned to=
=20
during the year -- and the state is fast approaching those limits.=20
""There are only about eight more times we can call on them this year,"" said=
=20
Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for the California Independent System=20
Operator, which runs most of the state's power grid.=20
QUOTAS NEARLY FULL
The situation is especially bad in Northern and Central California, where a=
ll=20
but a handful of Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s 170 interruptible customers=
=20
have already reached their quotas for the year.=20
""These customers are mostly big manufacturers, food processors and companie=
s=20
like that,"" said Staci Homrig, a PG&E spokeswoman. ""The ISO called on us a=
=20
lot.""=20
With the state's creaky, overworked power system poised on the knife's edge=
=20
between demand and capacity, the interruptible customers often are all that=
=20
keep the system from tipping over into rolling blackouts.=20
""They are a huge, huge help,"" McCorkle said.=20
Last Monday, for example, the ISO ordered interruptible customers to cut=20
their loads shortly after 10 a.m. Within 30 minutes, the power crunch had=
=20
started to ease, as about 900 megawatts of demand dropped out of the system=
.=20
That's enough power to supply 900,000 homes.=20
It wasn't until late in the afternoon, when those companies reached their=
=20
six-hour daily limit and were allowed to power back up, that an hourlong=20
blackout became necessary.=20
Thursday, the cooperation of interruptible customers meant blackouts were=
=20
never called.=20
DIFFICULTIES FOR CUSTOMERS
The power cuts aren't easy for the businesses ordered to make them.=20
Hanson Permanente Cement in Pleasanton is one of the companies that already=
=20
has used up its voluntary blackout hours for the year.=20
""In January, the outages essentially put us out of business,"" said Earl=20
Bouse, who runs the company. ""It put us in a situation where we couldn't ma=
ke=20
product.""=20
The plant, which has 200 employees and operates 24 hours a day, gets only a=
=20
half-hour's notice to shut down. That means the kilns have to be powered=20
down, machinery turned off and the lights dimmed. Only a minimal amount of=
=20
power remains online.=20
But even when the lights come back on, things don't immediately return to=
=20
normal, Bouse said.=20
""If we're down for four hours, it's another 20 hours before we're up and=20
running at capacity,"" he said.=20
In exchange for the headaches -- and lost business -- the cement company pa=
ys=20
an electricity rate that is 15 to 20 percent below what PG&E normally=20
charges. That is a major incentive for a company where power makes up about=
=20
15 percent of its total costs.=20
""For companies paying a $10 million electricity bill, that's a savings of $=
2=20
million a year,"" Homrig said.=20
For years, it was even a better deal. Although the interruptible power=20
program has existed since the mid-1980s, the power was almost never=20
interrupted. Companies signing up for the program have received $2 billion =
in=20
reduced rates since 1990, but until recently they never had to turn off the=
ir=20
lights.=20
From 1992 to 1999, for example, PG&E's interruptible customers were asked t=
o=20
cut power only 19 times. Southern California Edison, which has the bulk of=
=20
the interruptible companies, had only four curtailments, all in 1998.=20
When the power crunch hit last year, everything changed. Both PG&E and Edis=
on=20
called for power interruptions 20 times, and their customers started=20
screaming.=20
""It was an emergency capacity program, and no one expected we'd have so man=
y=20
emergencies,"" said Lynda Ziegler, an Edison executive.=20
A report by the state Public Utilities Commission in February was more=20
specific.=20
""Numerous customers, including some schools and hospitals, 'gamed' Edison's=
=20
tariffs,"" the PUC said. They figured that they could get the lower rate and=
=20
never have to cut power.=20
When Edison ordered the power shutdowns last year, only 62 percent of their=
=20
interruptible customers complied, despite signed contracts with the utility=
.=20
With PG&E, the compliance level was 96 percent.=20
NONCOMPLIERS TO THE SOUTH
Many of the Edison customers ""are unwilling or unable to lower their energy=
=20
use when requested,"" the PUC report concluded.=20
In 2000, Edison hit noncompliers with $92.4 million in penalties and PG&E=
=20
ordered $2.2 million in fines. Millions of dollars more were assessed this=
=20
year before threats of lawsuits, potential legislative action and howls fro=
m=20
California manufacturers persuaded the PUC to order the fines suspended lat=
e=20
in January. Much of the money probably will be returned.=20
Because of the controversy surrounding the interruptible program, state pow=
er=20
officials are trying to have a new, more flexible system in place by June.=
=20
The new program allows companies to cut only part of their electrical load=
=20
and limits the blackouts to four hours a day and 10 days a month.=20
""We're trying to get (customers representing) another 400 megawatts signed=
=20
up,"" Homrig said. ""That's the same as we have for the current program.""=20
Without the help an interruptible user program provides, California residen=
ts=20

Gray Davis warned yesterday that the state faces economic disaster this=20

""I don't think we can get through (the summer) without a price cap,"" Davis=

""President Bush could solve this problem in five minutes by asking them to=

Cheney, charged by Bush with examining the energy problem, has opposed pric=

alternative energy sources and more oil refineries, gas pipelines and nucle=

But the president, while trying to appear sympathetic, has responded that t=

power crisis is California's problem and the state has to fix it.=20
Yesterday, Davis did not rule out the possibility that the state might use=

its emergency powers to take control of private power plants if electricity=

e=20
possibility of seizing the power plants.=20
""I'm not ruling anything in, and I'm not ruling anything out,"" Davis said.=

He said his administration has approved building 14 new plants, including=

El Paso Energy was facing ruin.=20
It was the mid-'90s, and California's energy overseers were sure deregulati=

was going to drive the cost of natural gas through the floor. So Pacific Ga=
s=20
and Electric Co., with the happy acquiescence of the state, dumped a huge,=
=20
long-term gas contract with El Paso.=20
For the state, the decision was a no-brainer: PG&E was buying more space on=
=20
gas pipelines than it needed.=20
For El Paso, though, it was a disaster. The company started handing out pin=
k=20
slips like they were candy.=20
But in the long run, it wasn't El Paso that would end up on its knees. It=

soon become precious -- and El Paso, led by a law-sharp chairman with=20
bare-knuckle smarts, would turn itself into the biggest natural gas firm in=

the world.=20
So big, in fact, that in the eyes of vengeance-minded lawmakers and=20
regulators, El Paso has become a poster monster for how Californians came t=
o=20
be plagued by rolling blackouts and sky-high energy bills.=20
""They didn't mind seeing all of us at El Paso being dealt a terrible blow=
=20
back then,"" said Randy Wu, an El Paso manager then. ""And now . . . well,=20
let's just say they should have planned better."" -- -- --=20
It's not like El Paso was some new kid on the block.=20
The company was founded in Texas in 1928 and stayed a local concern until=

=20
It grew steadily from there until 1964, when the U.S. Supreme Court decided=

Wise, a 56-year-old whose lean build reflects both his passion for running=

=20
oil.=20
The University of Colorado law school graduate has mastered both the legal=
=20
side of his ""litigious"" industry, as he once called it, and its hardball=20
economic strategies -- skills he honed by surfing the bust-boom cycles of h=
is=20
business at its epicenter, Texas.=20
Those skills came in handy when El Paso got the hammer blow from PG&E in 19=
96=20
and 1997.=20
PG&E had been buying extra space on pipelines crossing into the state at th=
e=20
Arizona ghost town of Topock -- enough to import a whopping 1.1 billion cub=
ic=20
feet of natural gas a day.=20
The trouble for El Paso was that when PG&E dropped the contract for the=20
pipeline space, $170 million of the company's annual revenue was erased.=20
""It seemed like everyone thought the company was toast,"" said Wu, the forme=
r=20
El Paso manager. ""Of course, California didn't care at all.""=20
But Patrick Power, the attorney hired by El Paso to plead the pipeline=20
company's case before the state Public Utilities Commission back in 1996,=
=20
could see trouble looming for the state.=20
If PG&E and other utilities didn't keep the pipeline capacity to meet futur=
e=20
needs, he warned, they would probably regret it later. His words fell on de=
af=20
ears.=20
""The mentality at the PUC, PG&E and Southern California Gas was, 'This will=
=20
be El Paso's problem,' "" Power said. -- -- --=20
Wise reacted to the loss of the PG&E contract by taking no salary himself f=
or=20
a year and freezing his executives' pay, Wu said. While laying off more tha=
n=20
one-third of the company's workers, he and his staff negotiated a hefty=20
settlement from PG&E and other companies in exchange for their having dropp=
ed=20
the pipeline space.=20
Then Wise set off on a plan to absorb other pipeline companies so he could=
=20
expand his system of delivering natural gas throughout the United States.=
=20
""Bill Wise knew California had turned its back on the company, so he had to=
=20
get creative,"" Wu said of Wise, who has declined interview requests from Th=
e=20
Chronicle.=20
""Attorneys generally don't have a lot of common sense in my mind, but Bill =
-=20
- he's got extra,"" said former El Paso Mayor Larry Francis. ""He cuts his=20
losses in a hurry, and he recognizes when he has to move on. And so he=20
moved.""=20
Within a few years, Wise stretched the now Houston-based company to full=20
""wellhead to wire"" operations, running everything from natural gas drilling=
=20
to electric generation plants. Before El Paso embarked on this expansion,=
=20
California constituted fully two-thirds of El Paso's natural gas sales --=
=20
much of that to PG&E.=20
The strategy was that if the state was going to ditch El Paso, El Paso woul=
d=20
make sure its reach became so extended in other directions that it would=20
never be dependent on one market again.=20
Wise's company scooped up interests in 40 electric power plants in 11 state=
s=20
by April 2000. Along the way, it spent billions acquiring enough pipeline=
=20
companies to spread the El Paso reach along 58,000 miles of pipe nationwide=
,=20
from Bakersfield to Boston.=20
""The company was a very traditional gas company until then,"" said Fred=20
Pickel, a Los Angeles energy consultant who has observed El Paso since the=
=20
1970s. ""Wise, though, understands the street-level complexities of the=20
business, and what he had the company do was partly smart and partly logic.=
=20
""He was just able to see the possibilities that nobody here in California w=
as=20
able to see.""=20
But some believe that what El Paso did to take advantage of those=20
possibilities took unfair advantage of California.=20
In his cluttered downtown San Francisco office at the PUC, staff attorney=
=20
Harvey Morris thought he ""smelled a rat"" as long as three years ago.=20
Morris, a natty 47-year-old graduate of Boalt Hall School of Law, takes on=
=20
the look of a determined terrier when he outlines his suspicions about El=
=20
Paso -- and he's been carrying that look a long time now.=20
After losing PG&E, El Paso leased the utility's entire block of pipeline=20
capacity to another Texas gas and electricity giant, Dynegy. Gas experts we=
re=20
stunned that one firm would bid for all that space -- but they, and Morris,=
=20
were even more surprised by what followed.=20
Dynegy didn't behave the way PG&E and California officials had expected=20
energy companies to behave in the era of deregulation.=20
Like PG&E, Dynegy didn't need all that pipeline space to serve its own=20
customers. But unlike what PG&E did when confronted with all that extra=20
space, Dynegy didn't resell it at a huge discount. In fact, Dynegy didn't=
=20
sell any of the space. Instead, it raised the price so high that seemingly=
=20
nobody wanted to buy it.=20
Competing gas marketers were alarmed. They suspected that Dynegy was=20
collaborating with El Paso to constrict the supply of gas flowing into=20
California so prices would rise. Great for anyone with space reserved on th=
e=20
pipeline -- but disastrous for those left out in the cold.=20
In 1998, having convinced his bosses at the PUC that what El Paso was doing=
=20
on the Dynegy contract was anticompetitive, Morris filed the first of many=
=20
complaints with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. He's still pursui=
ng=20
them.=20
As it turned out, spot prices didn't rise while Dynegy held the contract; g=
as=20
shippers could still find space on other pipelines for less money. Dynegy l=
et=20
the contract lapse in late 1999.=20
Not long afterward, the pipeline contract wound up with El Paso's market=20
affiliate, El Paso Merchant Energy. And that's when things started to get=
=20
really serious, Morris says.=20
El Paso's own marketing arm now controlled more pipeline space heading into=
=20
Southern California than any other trader by far -- just as the demand for=
=20
gas was about to soar.=20
In his many filings, in which the PUC has been joined by Southern Californi=
a=20
Edison and others, Morris contends that El Paso Merchant Energy prevented=
=20
pipeline space from being used.=20
""They basically kept so much of the capacity to themselves, the prices went=
=20
through the roof,"" he said. ""It was the same as closing off part of the=20
pipeline.""=20
El Paso officials, for their part, say market rates started soaring in 2000=
=20
simply because the demand for gas overwhelmed supply. They say they never=
=20
charged more than what industry rules allowed, and that attempts to prove=
=20
otherwise are preposterous.=20
And thus far, except for a mild rebuke here and there on technicalities, th=
e=20
free-market-minded Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has not concluded t=
he=20
company did anything wrong -- though a commission hearing is set for tomorr=
ow=20
on the latest allegations filed by PG&E, Edison and the PUC.=20
Edison estimates that El Paso's ""manipulation"" at Topock jacked up rates al=
l=20
over the industry so badly that state gas buyers had to pay $3.8 billion mo=
re=20
than they should have just in the past year.=20
Whatever the reason, the bottom line is that gas prices in California have=
=20
been anywhere from two to 10 times as expensive as on the other side of the=
=20
border in Arizona, and in almost every other state.=20
Once prices started to rise at Topock, gas marketers throughout California=
=20
followed suit -- and the ripple spread quickly.=20
Gas prices for consumers started going up. The rise also propelled=20
electricity costs skyward, because three out of every five electricity plan=
ts=20
in California run on natural gas.=20
The firms that own those plants then jacked up electricity prices to the=20
utilities, like PG&E, which had shed many of their own plants as part of=20
deregulation.=20
The problem for PG&E and other utilities is that they couldn't pass those=
=20
higher electricity costs on to their customers, because electricity rates=
=20
were still regulated.=20
So the red ink started to gush, in the hundreds of millions of dollars. And=
,=20
with gas prices still higher here than anywhere else, it is still gushing.=
=20
But not for El Paso. -- -- --=20
El Paso Energy rose from its financial emergency in 1996 to become not just=

the energy industry in California and much of the rest of the United States=

The company, renamed El Paso Corp. this February, is now practically printi=

money. The company's revenue shot from $1 billion in 1995 to $22 billion la=
st=20
year; its profit last year alone was $652 million, its highest ever. Wise's=
=20
compensation package reportedly totaled $20 million.=20
And it's not just with gas that El Paso is making its money. Among its=20
holdings are 19 small power plants serving PG&E and Southern California=20

Under El Paso's contracts, the price of that electricity automatically rise=

All told, in just a bit more than one year alone, consultants for Edison sa=
y=20
El Paso earned an extra $85 million thanks to electricity produced by those=
=20
plants.=20
And all this is blossoming for El Paso while PG&E wallows in bankruptcy=20
court, billions of dollars in debt with no relief in sight.=20
The one cloud on El Paso's horizon: A host of California legislators,=20
industry experts and state regulators suspect that El Paso's sunny profit=

The hearing before federal regulators is looming tomorrow, and just last=20

El Paso executives -- but not Wise -- to Sacramento to testify on the matte=

It was the first time the company has ever felt such heat in this state. An=

though the executives grimly waved off reporters' questions as they strode=

from the room, company spokeswoman Norma Dunn stayed behind to insist that=
=20
the accusations will blow over, ""because there's nothing to them.=20
""The thing to remember is that we have been in this state for more than 50=

years, and we want to continue being here,"" Dunn said. ""We take this matter=
=20
very seriously. . . . We want to be cooperative.""=20
Accusations that El Paso caused price spikes by maneuvering to hold pipelin=
e=20

The Assembly panel, however, concluded that both El Paso and Dynegy had=20
manipulated the market at an enormous cost to California consumers.=20
""The numbers tell the truth,"" the subcommittee said in a report obtained by=
=20
The Chronicle. ""The exorbitant prices cannot be defined away by regulators=
=20
and bureaucrats, or explained away by corporate lawyers' wordplay."" The=20
report was produced by three Assembly Democrats and two Republicans.=20
Wise, when he addresses the accusations, says he is mystified why state=20

When it comes to California, ""El Paso has always tried to be a part of the=

solution, not the problem,"" he told a gas industry newsletter in December.=
=20
State lawmakers' attempts to pry extensive hard numbers from El Paso have=

information. And judging by Morris' experience, chasing El Paso to the grou=

may take the Legislature quite a while, if that's what it decides it wants =
to=20

Morris found that as he filed complaint after complaint against the company=
,=20
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would either rule against the PUC =
or=20
put the filings off so long that they were moot when they came up.=20
The Assembly subcommittee's report was scathing in regard to the commission=

saying its approval of El Paso pipeline contracts ""raises serious questions=
=20
about whether it met its statutory duty under the federal Natural Gas Act t=

The commission did not send anyone to the Assembly hearings and has refused=

""The damage was done long ago,"" Morris said. The state and its utilities ar=

on the hook for billions in debt, money for last winter's bills has already=

left consumers' pockets -- and regulators fear prices are unlikely to come=
=20
down soon.=20
""The market got set, and now we're in trouble,"" Morris said. -- -- --=20
PG&E, for its part, sees the whole mess through the eyes of a victim.=20
The utility had paid $560 million to hold its excess El Paso capacity from=
=20
1993 to 1997, and the PUC had forbidden the company to recover $167 million=
=20
of that through customer rates. And in 1996, the PUC and ratepayers were=20
clamoring for lower power bills, and there was a huge amount of pipeline=20
space in the state that wasn't being used.=20
So when you're trying to cut costs, what better to cut than something you=
=20
don't need? said Dan Thomas, PG&E's director of gas transmission.=20
""I still think it was the right decision to relinquish the capacity,"" he=20
said.=20
Still, there's no denying the numbers. At latest count, PG&E owed El Paso=
=20
more than $150 million for gas and electricity.=20
As Morris sees it, El Paso is ""this big, 800-pound gorilla at the border an=

energy companies will charge California this summer.=20
The California Public Utilities Commission today plans to approve a larger=

Most analysts cite the dramatic jump in gas-fired electricity generation in=
=20
recent years as the major factor causing current supply constraints.=20
Information analyzed from Boulder, Colo.-based RDI's POWERdat series=20
indicates this growth trend is starting to level out.=20

In contrast, 2000 saw a slight increase of both coal and oil for electric=
=20
power generation, suggesting that fuel switching and consequent natural gas=
=20
demand destruction may play a growing role in power markets.=20

""The demand side of the story appears to be a bit confused, but one thing=
=20
that's clear from this past winter is that more fuel switching to liquids=
=20
occurred than most of us thought possible in such a short period of time,""=
=20
said EOG Resources CEO Mark Papa during a recent conference call with=20
investors.=20

Despite the disproportionately low natural gas supply response relative to=
=20
rig count increases, RDI data, along with bullish underground natural gas=
=20
storage levels, may be early indications that the gas market is inching=20
toward equilibrium.=20

Natural gas burn slows
The U.S. consumed about 6,555 trillion British thermal units (Btus) of=20
natural gas for electricity generation in 2000, an increase of about 616=20
trillion Btus over 1999 levels. This is in sharp contrast to the previous=
=20
year's extraordinary jump of 2,631 trillion Btus.=20

In 2000, the 487 TWh of power generated from natural gas accounted for abou=
t=20
14% of the nation's total. This was not far above 1999's 455 TWh. The lack =
of=20
change is a stark shift from just a year prior; in 1998, only 260 TWh of=20
power were generated using natural gas.=20

Texas (ERCOT) topped the list in terms of the greatest use of natural gas f=
or=20
electric power generation, where 1,643 trillion Btus were burned. Although=
=20
this is an increase of about 148 trillion Btus from 1999 levels, it is a=20
relatively small increase in comparison to the near 454 trillion Btu increa=
se=20
this gas-rich region experienced from 1998 to 1999.=20

During 2000, the one anomaly in terms of gas growth was=01*not surprisingly=
=01*the=20
North American Electric Reliability Council's (NERC) Western Systems=20
Coordinating Council (WSCC) region that covers 11 states, including=20
California. Here, gas consumption rose by 431 trillion Btus during 2000, an=
=20
amount that comes close to the 524 trillion Btu increase from 1998 to 1999.=
=20



Coal dominates
RDI's POWERdat database shows coal was responsible for about 1,956 TWh of=
=20
power generation through the end of 2000. While that figure is up about 2.5=
%=20
from the close of 1999, coal's nationwide share has declined from about 56.=
4%=20
in 1998 to the current level of 54%.=20

Despite this relative decline, however, coal continues to dominate the powe=
r=20
generation market, and its consumption grew slightly in all NERC regions=20
during 2000, continuing the upward trend visible since 1998. The most=20
significant growth was experienced in southern states (excluding Florida).=
=20
The second-largest growth in coal use was in the mid-central eastern states=
=20
(East Central Area Reliability Council or ECAR).=20



Balanced portfolios?=20
California's problems have vividly illustrated the value of a balanced=20
fuel-use portfolio for electric power generation. As of the close of 2000,=
=20
nationwide, coal dominates at 54%, followed by uranium at a distant second =
at=20
21%. Natural gas is gaining ground with 14% of the nation's total fuel use=
=20
for electricity generation.=20


Regionally, the distribution is much more variable. For example, about 37% =
of=20
the fossil fuel consumed in the WSCC region for power generation was natura=
l=20
gas in 2000 compared to 29% in 1999. In absolute terms, several other regio=
ns=20
consume similar amounts of costly natural gas for power production. The NPP=
C=20
region=01*New England including New York=01*relied on natural gas for about=
 40% of=20
its power generation in 2000 followed by SPP (primarily Oklahoma) with abou=
t=20
33%.



The distribution of fuel use is, in most cases, linked to available=20
resources. Given its proximity to natural gas reserves, for example, Texas=
=20
relied on this fuel for a full 60% of its power generation in 2000, up from=
=20
55% in 1999. While less at risk for supply disruptions, a heavy dependence =
on=20
natural gas presents more exposure to its price volatility. On average, tot=
al=20
production costs for natural gas-fired generation topped $50 per MWh in 200=
0,=20
making it second to the total production costs for solar power.=20



There have been reports of potential coal shortages this summer, which coul=

impact areas highly dependent on these sources, such as southern states, an=
d=20
the mid-continent areas where power generation relies almost exclusively on=

But last week the picture was a little different. Irvine's broad avenues ha=

because of California's power shortages. The hundreds of computer-operated=

traffic lights here were blank witnesses to the morass, as were the city's=

police officers, who arrived at some major intersections only to watch=20
helplessly until the electricity was switched back on an hour later.=20
Charles Brobeck, the chief of police, explained the one-sided arithmetic he=

was up against. Irvine has 279 signal intersections and only 160 officers o=

the police force, with only a portion of them on duty at one time. As a=20
result, he said, ''we're too badly outnumbered to do much,'' in spite of=20
hundreds of hours spent planning for the blackouts.=20
''When we get notice that these things are coming it's like being told that=
=20
in 10 minutes there's an asteroid that's going to hit us,'' Chief Brobeck=
=20
said. ''We know it's five million miles from earth, and it's going to hit,=
=20
but we're not quite sure when or exactly where.''=20
Last week gave just a hint of the improvisational tap dances local=20
governments are going to have to do all summer to cope with the rolling=20
blackouts. Municipalities across the state, the principal lines of defense=
=20
against chaos, have spent the last several months meticulously planning wha=
t=20
they can plan. That has meant crash energy conservation programs and steps =
to=20
ensure that critical services like the police and fire departments and=20
computer centers remain in operation at all times.=20
But local officials said there was precious little their governments could =
do=20
beyond that during the predictably unpredictable but brief blackouts, usual=
ly=20
an hour long.=20
Southern California's experience with earthquakes and wildfires has helped=
=20
instill a sense of preparedness, but only to a degree. Because the=20
patchworklike blackouts are short-lived and require pinpoint actions rather=
=20
than wide-scale mobilization, officials said, they are fundamentally more=
=20
challenging.=20
The incidents last week offered two perfect examples, said Ronald Mohr, an=
=20
energy analyst with the Los Angeles County government.=20
On Tuesday, he had just minutes' notice that blocks of the county's power=
=20
system were about to be blacked out by the local utility, Southern Californ=
ia=20
Edison, except he was not sure which blocks, or for precisely how long, or=
=20
exactly when it would happen.=20
He had seconds to notify the most important of the county government's 87,0=
00=20
employees, but without using telephones, because that would take too long, =
as=20
he had discovered on previous blackouts, and without sending too many e-mai=
l=20
messages at once, because that would cause the system to crash.=20
And then there was Wednesday. Again, Mr. Mohr received notice of imminent=
=20
blackouts from Southern California Edison, bringing another round of franti=
c=20
measures, except this time it turned out to be a false alarm.=20
''My entire life has been turned upside down,'' Mr. Mohr said. He explained=
=20
that taking part in energy policy had been such a ponderously slow process =
in=20
the past that it could take him four days to prepare a short letter.=20
''We've been working 14-, 16-hour days.'' he said. ''My boss just missed hi=
s=20
anniversary. The main thing is that before, with emergency procedures, you=
=20
knew the rules. Everything was stable. You took a manual off a shelf. There=
=20
is no manual for a one-hour blackout.''=20
Traffic may be the worst problem in the blackouts. For instance, in Ventura=
,=20
just north of here, the streets immediately came close to gridlock on=20
Tuesday, and officials could only counsel patience.=20
''We just leave the intersections dark,'' said Ronald Calkins, director of=
=20
the city's Department of Public Works. ''The motorists just have to know th=
at=20
they are supposed to treat it as a four-way stop. We thought about using=20
portable stop signs, but it takes too long. By the time you get the stuff o=
ut=20
the lights are back on.''=20
In Irvine, there were three fender benders during Tuesday's blackout; in=20
Santa Monica, one car was rammed so hard at an intersection that it flipped=
=20
over.=20
Eileen Salmon, Irvine's emergency coordinator, said the best that could be=
=20
done, once care is taken to make sure essential services keep running, was =
to=20
communicate, but even doing that can be problematic. Ms. Salmon said that=
=20
last Tuesday she received several false alarms before the blackouts, making=
=20
her responses something of a guessing game.=20
She said most city operations were just told to wait out the blackouts.=20
Schools, she said, do nothing special; and city employees just take a break=
=20
for the most part.=20
Allison Hart, the Irvine city manager, said the lack of specific advance=20
information from Southern California Edison was another problem.=20
The utilities have said that they do not identify which areas will lose pow=
er=20
in advance because of concerns that criminals might take advantage of the=
=20
situation by looting or breaking into buildings.=20
''If you think the possibility of looting or something is worse than the=20
devastating economic uncertainty of being hit by unpredictable rolling=20
blackouts in the sixth-largest economy in the world, I just think you're=20
wrong,'' Ms. Hart said, adding that business groups have said they would=20
prefer more notice as well.=20
The municipalities usually have backup diesel generators at critical sites,=
=20
but even using those can pose difficulties. Many city officials said that a=
s=20
they get warnings that power is running short, they are inclined to fire up=
=20
their generators early so that important facilities will never lose=20
electricity.=20
But state air quality rules restrict how long the cities can operate the=20
generators, usually to 200 hours a year. If the generators are left running=
=20
an hour or two every time there is a warning, as happened on Wednesday, the=
=20
officials fear they will waste precious operating time.=20
Mr. Mohr said that perhaps the greatest trial would be keeping municipal=20
employees alert in a summer when emergency warnings would be the norm.=20
Already, he said, officials are struggling against complacency.=20
''Please don't let a lazy or indifferent attitude develop due to the false=
=20
predictions,'' Mr. Mohr pleaded in a mass e-mail message sent after=20
Wednesday's near miss.=20
Then he added, ''This will be the last message tonight, unless conditions=

Daniel Weintraub: Consumer rep envisions ultimate confrontation


(Published May 15, 2001)=20

Now that Gov. Gray Davis has rallied his fellow Democrats, run over the=20
Republican opposition in the Legislature and set the state on a course to=
=20
borrow $13 billion to pay for a few months of electricity purchases, there'=
s=20
probably only one person who can stop him: Harvey Rosenfield.=20
Rosenfield is the Santa Monica-based consumer advocate who tried to halt=20
California's experiment in electricity deregulation before it got started.=
=20
His 1998 ballot measure failed, and that campaign is blamed in some circles=
=20
for delaying construction of new power plants just long enough to cause the=

electricity shortage that's helped send prices heavenward.=20
But if Rosenfield's last ballot initiative got the state's energy=20

them over the edge. He is seriously considering launching a signature drive=

to force a referendum on the legislation Davis just signed to authorize his=

$13 billion energy bond measure.=20
That bond, to be repaid by ratepayers, is supposed to reimburse the state's=
=20
general fund for the cost of electricity the state has been buying for=20
consumers since January, when Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern Californi=

in=20

would immediately face another staggering rate increase, probably well into=
=20
triple digits.=20
The alternative would be a state budget in shambles. All the tax money Davi=

services such as education, roads and health care. A referendum that killed=
=20
the bond measure would leave a gaping hole in the budget that could only be=
=20
filled by a huge tax increase or unprecedented spending cuts.=20
Rosenfield is something of a publicity hound, and his talk of a referendum=

may be just that. Collecting 750,000 signatures in less than 90 days, which=
=20
is what's required to qualify the referendum, would be a massive undertakin=

ot=20
already, including one in 1988 that brought on regulation of the California=

The question is why he would even consider it. Why would a man who fancies=

himself a friend of the ratepayer ponder a move that would force consumers =
to=20
swallow a massive rate hike, or else bankrupt the state? Because Rosenfield=
's=20

and the generators will kick the habit, fast.=20
""If bleeding dry the general fund is foreclosed, and politically or as a=20

capitalism will blink.=20
""If the lights go off in California, and the economy goes down the tubes,=

The Legislature already has set a Nov. 15 deadline after which the state=20

?????WASHINGTON--A Texas energy conglomerate accused of driving up natural=

?????FERC economist Jonathan Ogur said that under certain conditions during=

ed=20
as much as 45% of the pipeline capacity for shipping gas to Southern=20
California. That share exceeds a commonly used threshold of 35%, raising=20

?????""We obviously disagree with that,"" said Bill Sherman, lead lawyer for =
El=20

withholding supply in a bid to raise prices. It had contracted with its=20
pipeline affiliate--El Paso Natural Gas Co.--for rights to ship 1.2 billion=
=20
cubic feet of natural gas a day to California.
?????The El Paso firms say the allegations are based on a misrepresentation=

of how their relationship worked. They argue that natural gas prices in=20
California have spiked much higher than elsewhere in the country because of=
=20
insatiable demand from power plants, a lack of pipeline capacity within the=

?????The issue of market share appeared to loom large in the administrative=

hearing, which has become the closest thing to a trial arising from=20
California's energy crisis. A company that controls a large portion of any=

?????El Paso Merchant has argued that its market share should be computed a=

?????But the PUC counters that, because of difficulties in shipping gas fro=

Judge Asked to Block Freeze on Power Rate=20

?????After three hours of arguments, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali=
=20
said he will prepare a written decision. ""It will be issued when I am ready=

?????The legal battle represents PG&E's first attempt to use its bankruptcy=

?????PG&E has asked Montali to block a key accounting order the commissione=

argument.
?????""Because we have commissioners who are shielded by sovereign immunity,=

Edison Deal Sets High Legislative Hurdle for Davis=20

?????SACRAMENTO--Gov. Gray Davis faces the toughest legislative challenge o=
f=20
his tenure as he tries to win votes for a deal he says is needed to keep=20
Southern California Edison out of bankruptcy--even as lawmakers work on=20
alternative plans.
?????Davis has tapped Sen. Richard Polanco to carry the bill, and the Los=
=20
Angeles Democrat is expected to introduce legislation implementing key part=
s=20
of the Edison deal this week. But even before hearings begin, key lawmakers=
=20
say the Davis plan has little chance of success, at least not in its curren=
t=20
form.
?????Some Democrats in the Assembly are considering the possibility that th=
e=20
effort to rescue Edison could falter, that the company could end up in=20
bankruptcy, and that the state might buy the utility, according to a summar=

of various plans prepared by Assembly Democrats.
?????The document, prepared for Assembly leaders, shows that at least some=
=20
members of the lower house are thinking about making a run at buying Edison=
's=20
Northern California counterpart, Pacific Gas & Electric, which filed for=20
bankruptcy last month.
?????""The state would assume existing secured debt . . . and would pay the=
=20
unsecured debt using a combination of the cash that has been hoarded by the=
=20
utility . . . and new cash from revenue bonds issued by the California Powe=
r=20
Authority,"" the document obtained by The Times says.
?????With Edison's stock price depressed, the cost to the state would be=20
perhaps $1 billion to $2 billion. PG&E's cost might be less, the document=
=20
suggests. The state would have to spend additional sums to pay off the=20
utilities' creditors.
?????""I don't know if we have even contemplated that thought,"" Davis=20
spokesman Steve Maviglio said of a potential bankruptcy. ""We're still=20
optimistic that the Legislature will agree to the [deal] or a framework tha=
t=20
encompasses most of it.""
?????Lawmakers, meanwhile, shut down their special session on energy Monday=
,=20
a necessary step so the state could sell as much as $13.4 billion in bonds =
by=20
August to pay for power purchases. Davis quickly reconvened a second specia=
l=20
session to deal with many other energy bills.

?????Measure Would Use Part of Utility Bills
?????""This is not going to be solved by the state buying the utilities,"" sa=
id=20
Bob Foster, the Edison executive who oversees lobbying operation. ""It is ti=
me=20
to get real here. The state has a crisis on its hands. It needs to start=20
digging out.""
?????The 98-page bill would authorize the state to pay $2.76 billion to buy=
=20
Edison's high voltage transmission lines, and permit the state to sell bond=
s=20
to finance the purchase. Edison would use the money to restructure and pay=
=20
down its debt, pegged at $3.5 billion.
?????Additionally, the bill would earmark part of ratepayers' monthly utili=
ty=20
bills to be used by Edison to pay off debt it incurred in 2000 and early th=
is=20
year as state regulators barred the company from charging consumers for the=
=20
full cost of record wholesale electricity prices.
?????""The state of California needs to get out of the business of buying=20
electricity,"" Polanco said, adding that the measure assumes Edison would ta=
ke=20
over the chore of buying power at the end of 2002 once it gains financial=
=20
stability. ""My reasons for stepping up to the plate is to deal with it and=
=20
get it behind us.""
?????Passage of the bill requires simple majorities in the 40-seat Senate a=
nd=20
80-seat Assembly. But Davis is having a hard time persuading fellow Democra=
ts=20
to embrace the proposal, and Republicans shudder at the prospect of the sta=
te=20
getting more deeply involved in the power business by taking over Edison's=
=20
transmission system. Some think Edison should follow PG&E into Bankruptcy=
=20
Court.

?????Some Officials Prefer Bankruptcy Option
?????""Why should we spend $3.5 billion for something the Bankruptcy Court=
=20
does for free?"" Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) asked. ""I don't hear=
=20
anybody voicing support for the bailout.""
?????Added Sen. Martha Escutia (D-Whittier): ""I haven't been given any=20
argument why bankruptcy is bad.""
?????Escutia said one of Davis' top aides jokingly threatened to lock Escut=
ia=20
in a padded room until she voted for the bill. ""I told her the governor wou=
ld=20
have to put me in a straitjacket, and I still wouldn't vote for it.""
?????Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, the Legislature's most influenti=
al=20
Democrat, said he would prefer that Edison not file for bankruptcy, but tha=
t=20
the bankruptcy of Edison's Northern California counterpart, PG&E, has had=
=20
little day-to-day impact.
?????""Bankruptcy is not something I'm afraid of,"" Burton said.
?????Burton's biggest criticism of the Davis-Edison accord is that it would=

allow independent power sellers, most of which are out-of-state firms, to=

recoup all money owed them by Edison.
?????Burton said no deal will win passage unless the independent generators=

?????Burton's idea is one of at least four alternatives to the Davis-Edison=

deal now in the works at the Capitol.
?????In the lower house, the plan with the most support is being pushed by=

Assemblymen John Dutra (D-Fremont) and Joe Nation (D-San Rafael). It would=

Benjamin was escorted from the hall by a California Highway Patrol officer=

after going well past her allotted three minutes of public-comment time.=20
""Shame on you,"" protesters shouted at the commissioners.=20
Other speakers asked the commissioners how they could purport to represent=

California's argument that a Texas energy company drove natural gas prices =

yesterday from federal regulators' main witness in an investigative hearing=

Evidence strongly indicates that El Paso Corp. inflated natural gas prices=
=20
through its dominance of the company's pipeline into Southern California, a=
=20
staff economist for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission concluded in=

written comments filed in the case.=20
The report by Jonathan Ogur, a Cornell-trained expert in market competition=
,=20
marks a departure from past findings of the federal commission that cleared=
=20
El Paso of wrongdoing.=20
""It is likely that El Paso Corp. had and exercised market power during the=

=20

EL PASO DENIES CHARGES
El Paso vigorously denies that it manipulated the gas market. It says gas=
=20
prices in the state have varied from two to 10 times more than elsewhere=20
because demand in California is high and existing pipelines and storage=20
basins are inadequate to meet it.=20
The federal commission in March rejected complaints by the California Publi=
c=20
Utilities Commission that El Paso rigged the bid for a huge block of space =
on=20
its pipeline early last year so that its own gas marketing affiliate could=
=20

But the federal commission ordered further hearings before an administrativ=
e=20
law judge to determine whether El Paso then elbowed out other gas traders=
=20
that might have used the pipeline to ship cheaper gas into the state.=20
That's the accusation leveled at El Paso by the state and California's two=
=20
major utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Ediso=
n.=20
They say the company's conduct jacked up prices for natural gas and had a=
=20

El Paso for gas and electricity purchases.=20
PIPELINE ACCESS CONTROLLED
PG&E once controlled the space on the El Paso pipeline, but dropped it in=

1997 because it didn't need it at the time. Gas prices from the pipeline=20
started climbing in 2000, when El Paso controlled the space and, critics sa=
y,=20
limited access to it by potential competitors.=20
A report commissioned by Edison estimated that California paid an extra $3.=
 8=20
billion for natural gas alone between March 1, 2000, and this past March 31=
=20
because of El Paso's domination of the pipeline space.=20
$864 MILLION PAID TO EL PASO=20
Some $864 million of that went to El Paso, said the Brattle Group, a=20
consulting firm. The company also reaped an extra $85 million from the powe=
r=20
plants it owns, Brattle said.=20
El Paso spokeswoman Norma Dunn said yesterday that the company welcomed the=
=20
expanded inquiry before the administrative law judge.=20
""We are pleased that we will finally have the opportunity to present the=20
facts about our participation in California's natural gas markets,"" Dunn=20
said. ""We are confident that once the facts are presented, El Paso will be=
=20
vindicated.""=20
Representatives for Edison, PG&E and the state Public Utilities Commission=

were unavailable for comment.=20
Ogur's conclusions are based on a complex mathematical evaluation of El=20

The report by Jonathan Ogur, a Cornell-trained expert in market competition=

""It is likely that El Paso Corp. had and exercised market power during the=

EL PASO DENIES CHARGES
El Paso vigorously denies that it manipulated the gas market. It says gas=
=20
prices in the state have varied from two to 10 times more than elsewhere=20
because demand in California is high and existing pipelines and storage=20
basins are inadequate to meet it.=20
The federal commission in March rejected complaints by the California Publi=
c=20
Utilities Commission that El Paso rigged the bid for a huge block of space =

=20

But the federal commission ordered further hearings before an administrativ=

PG&E once controlled the space on the El Paso pipeline, but dropped it in=

A report commissioned by Edison estimated that California paid an extra $3.=

because of El Paso's domination of the pipeline space.=20

El Paso spokeswoman Norma Dunn said yesterday that the company welcomed the=

Sacramento -- Blaming the tech-stock slide, Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday=
=20
that there is a $3.5 billion hole in California's coming budget that he=20
proposes filling with relatively painless cuts that spare public schools.=
=20
By squirreling away billions from the past two years, when California had=
=20
huge budget surpluses, the Democratic governor avoided having to propose de=
ep=20
whacks to existing state programs.=20
Instead, he wants to pare back one-time spending proposals, eliminating $25=
0=20
million for cities and counties, and use unspent state money approved in pa=
st=20
budgets to cushion the blow.=20
""We knew this day would come. Happily, we had the discipline to prepare for=
=20
it,"" Davis said in presenting his spending plan.=20
The May revision, as yesterday's event is called, is when negotiations over=
=20
the state's spending plan heat up.=20
Lawmakers are supposed to approve their version of the budget by June 15 so=
=20
Davis can review it and have it in place for the start of the new fiscal=20
year, July 1.=20
Republicans, whose votes are needed for the document to be approved, said=
=20
Davis isn't being fiscally conservative enough. They say the plan drains=20
reserves without considering that the economic downturn could last more tha=
n=20
just a year.=20
""The budget's short overall. He needs to come up with more cuts,"" said Sen.=
=20
Dick Ackerman, R-Fullerton, vice chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.=
=20
""The reserve is not adequate. It's not a very realistic document because it=
=20
doesn't take into account the economic downturn or the size of our energy=
=20
costs.""=20
The revision is simply a look at whether the projections the governor made =
in=20
his January budget still hold true. Instead of a total budget of $104.7=20
billion outlined earlier this year, Davis now envisions a spending package =
of=20
$102.9 billion.=20
For the first two years of Davis' administration those projections were=20
wildly conservative, yielding last year a staggering $12.3 billion in=20
unexpected revenue.=20
This year, a slack stock market and a cooling state economy had the opposit=
e=20
effect -- for the first time in nearly a decade the state will take in less=
=20
revenue than it did in a previous year.=20
""The declining Nasdaq, more than anything else, is responsible for the drop=
=20
in revenue we're seeing this year,"" Davis said.=20
Davis predicts that the state next year will take in $5.3 billion less=20
revenue than this year.=20
However, higher-than-anticipated tax payments in April mean the state will=
=20
end the current fiscal year on June 30 with an extra $1.4 billion.=20
The governor uses that surplus and hundreds of millions of dollars in=20
transfers to winnow the next budget's shortfall to $3.5 billion.=20
He assumes a proposed bond sale this summer will erase the state's more tha=
n=20
$6 billion in emergency electricity purchases.=20
Davis said his two spending priorities are public schools and public safety=
.=20
In the face of the shortage, Davis not only gave schools what he offered in=
=20
his January spending plan -- some $1.8 billion above the minimum schools ar=
e=20
guaranteed by law -- but added $676 million.=20
Of the $676 million, $541 million is one-time money to help defray higher=
=20
power bills brought on by the state's energy crisis. That works out to abou=
t=20
$90 per student for higher energy bills, more than the schools had requeste=
d.=20
Because enrollment is higher than expected in January, per-pupil spending=
=20
fell slightly from $1,176 to $1,168. School officials throughout the state=
=20
were pleased that their budgets weren't cut, as they work to raise test=20
scores through a variety of new programs.=20
Kevin Gordon, a lobbyist for school administrators, said that if school=20
districts suddenly had to deal with funding cuts, they would be hard presse=
d=20
to continue the progress in academic achievement seen recently.=20
Davis does not cut higher education, either, giving it a 2 percent increase=
=20
over this year, as opposed to the 4 percent increase he pitched in January.=
=20
He also preserves $160 million to begin construction of a new University of=
=20
California campus in Merced but, to save money, pays for it with bonds=20
instead of cash.=20
Among the one-time items eliminated was $40 million for a three-county pilo=
t=20
project to experiment with touch-screen voting.=20
Davis also cut $350 million from the the state's housing department,=20
including $200 million in grants to cities and counties that increase their=
=20
stock of homes and apartments.=20
The governor eliminated a $37.5 million proposal to clean up toxic-waste=20
sites in urban areas and pared down to $10 million from $100 million a=20
program to clean up beaches, mainly in Southern California.=20
Davis abandoned several tax cuts he proposed in January to save $50 million=
.=20
Among the casualties was a three-day sales tax holiday in August for back-t=
o-=20
school shoppers.=20
Davis also assumes that a quarter-cent sales tax cut caused by the state=20
being so flush with cash will end next January, allowing consumers to=20
contribute $1.2 billion in additional taxes to help fill the budget hole.=
=20
The key to Davis' budget proposal is spending $5 billion of the state's $6=

That means in the fiscal year beginning July 1, the state will spend some $=

Abruptly postponing a decision until today, state regulators on Monday bega=
n=20
revising an electricity rate proposal, with indications that businesses wou=
ld=20
get more of a break and residential customers would take a greater hit.=20
Public Utilities Commission member Jeff Brown said he asked for the changes=
=20
late Friday after hearing testimony from business groups that a huge rate=
=20
increase would hurt the state's economy. Brown said he was particularly=20
concerned by the big increases proposed for electricity rates for peak-peri=
od=20
usage.=20
``There are some people that cannot go off-peak,'' Brown said, ``and those=

people will pass their costs on to consumers, or they might take their=20
business out of California. Either way, the impact on the economy will be=
=20

Under the revised proposal, moderate residential users apparently will take=
 a=20

Brown said.=20
Brown's efforts to change the rate proposal apparently were being pushed by=
=20
Gov. Gray Davis, who appointed Brown and has taken an active interest in ho=
w=20
the $5 billion rate increase is divvied up among users.=20
Davis presented his own rate proposal to the commission a couple of weeks=
=20
ago. It gave agricultural groups and industrial users a bigger break than=
=20
plans released by the PUC last week.=20
``Our staff has been working with Mr. Brown to make the rate increase refle=
ct=20
the governor's wishes,'' said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio.=20
Last week, the commission released two proposals for how to distribute the=
=20
increase -- one from Commission President Loretta Lynch and one from=20
Administrative Law Judge Christine Walwyn.=20
Both proposals created a tiered system for residential users, with the=20
biggest power hogs getting slapped with the highest rates. And both skewed=
=20
the rate increase against commercial and industrial users. According to one=
=20
PUC analysis, the average increase for industrial users was 50 percent, wit=
h=20
some businesses facing on-peak rate increase of 250 percent.=20
Although business groups have enjoyed disproportionately lower rates in=20
recent years, they reacted strongly to the plans, insisting the higher=20
electric rates would drive some companies to ruin and hurt the state's=20
already foundering economy.=20
Attorneys representing agricultural, industrial and big and small business=
=20
groups dominated the final rate-setting hearing Friday. And groups such as=
=20
the California Manufacturers and Technology Association urged their members=
=20
to bombard the PUC with letters.=20
The limits of relief=20
Brown said he had originally tried to bring the average increase for=20
industrial users down from 50 percent to 45 percent, but that shifted too=
=20
much of the rate increase onto residential users.=20
``So we're looking at a very little more for residential users and taking i=
t=20
down a little for industrial,'' Brown said.=20
Lynch had not released details of the revised proposals Monday night.=20
But Brown released figures that he said were being seriously considered.=20
Customers who keep their usage within 130 percent of their baseline would=
=20
still be exempt from higher rates, as required by state law.=20
Among Pacific Gas & Electric customers, moderate residential users (between=
=20
130 and 200 percent of baseline) who originally faced a 28 percent rate=20
increase would now see a 33 percent increase, Brown said. Heavier users wou=
ld=20
see the rise in their rate jump from 39 percent to 55 percent. But the=20
heaviest residential users, originally slated for a 147 percent increase,=
=20
would now see a rate increase of only 75 percent.=20
Consumer groups were not happy.=20
``This is really hitting people who are moderate users who cannot fit withi=
n=20
their baseline,'' said Michael Florio, an attorney with The Utility Reform=
=20
Network. ``It's going easy on the really exorbitant users, who you would=20
think are pretty well-off.''=20
Lynch said immediately after the meeting that she wanted to spread more of=
=20
the rate increase to other residential users ``to ensure conservation=20
incentives are at every tier.'' And indeed, some energy experts had urged t=
he=20
commission to be more aggressive with the residential rates as a way to spu=
r=20
conservation.=20
Skeptics abide=20
But one consumer advocate scoffed at the notion, arguing that higher rates=
=20
will not lead to significantly higher conservation by homeowners.=20
``It seems like big industry and the environmentalists have gotten together=
=20
to try to get people to conserve through higher rates,'' said Harry Snyder,=
=20
senior advocate at Consumers Union in San Francisco. ``But the way to=20
conserve is not through forcing it.''=20
Snyder accused the commission of doing the ``hokey-pokey, changing everythi=
ng=20
by the reaction they get.''=20
Anti-rate-increase activists dominated much of Monday's meeting, showing up=
=20
dressed as ``Ratebusters'' and frequently interrupting the meeting with=20
chants (``I ain't payin' no hikes!'').=20
All they apparently got in return were a few chuckles from the commissioner=
s=20
and stern glares from the many California Highway Patrol officers stationed=

The commission is scheduled to vote on the new rate plan today at 2 p.m.=20

Double power punch: Rate hikes set; blackout blues ahead

The decision dismayed representatives of small consumers and big businesses=

two different proposals had come down to no more than 55 percent. On Tuesda=

that was lowered again to 49 percent.=20
Even so, the decision was criticized by commissioner Richard Bilas as a=20

""Every consumer in California is justified in feeling outrage at the rates =

her 69-page decision, blaming the increases on ""wholesale price gouging"" an=

inaction by federal regulators.=20
Lynch said the new rates will fuel conservation, but business interests hav=

argued that so many power users are fully or partly shielded that it will=

blunt the conservation signal that could be sent by even higher rates.=20
Under Tuesday's decision, agricultural rate hikes were capped at 15 percent=
=20
to 20 percent, partly in response to Davis' urgings.=20
The governor, who had urged the commission to go easier on agriculture and=

enact a lower overall increase, said in a statement that the rate hikes mad=

""modest improvements"" over earlier proposals but ""my plan represented a mor=

Pacific Gas and Electric's baseline varies depending on the region and the=

Households that qualify for special low-income rates or special medical rat=

For other residential power users, electricity will get progressively more=

Under the five new residential rate tiers, a PG&E customer whose use tops o=

total bill, which would increase from an average of $232 to $317, the=20
commission said.=20
Small businesses would face increases ranging from 34 percent to 45 percent=
.=20
While the percentage increases would seem to favor smaller consumers, the=

underlying rates are highest for residential customers.=20
Households with usage above 130 percent of baseline will now pay PG&E an=20

An energy council expects five times the outages forecast
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published May 16, 2001)=20
In the bleakest assessment yet of California's summertime energy shortage, =
an=20
industry association Tuesday predicted the state will suffer five times as=
=20
many rolling blackouts as previously forecast.=20
Moreover, the group said the blackouts will be twice as widespread --=20
affecting twice as many Californians at a time -- as any the state has=20
experienced this year.=20
The North American Electric Reliability Council predicted 15 hours of=20
blackouts a week through September, vs. about three hours under assumptions=
=20
released by the Independent System Operator, which runs California's power=
=20
grid. The council's prediction sharply contrasted with predictions by Gov.=
=20
Gray Davis, who has said the state will avoid major problems this summer.=
=20
""All indications are, there are going to be chronic problems this summer,""=
=20
said Tim Gallagher, manager of technical services at the reliability counci=
l.=20
He said Californians for the first time can expect blackouts during odd hou=
rs=20
and on weekends, instead of just the late-afternoon hours when electricity=
=20
consumption usually peaks.=20
A Princeton, N.J., nonprofit group funded by the energy industry and=20
dedicated to monitoring the nation's power supplies, the reliability counci=
l=20
said electricity supplies may be iffy this summer in the Pacific Northwest,=
=20
New York, New England and Texas. The only state where it predicted blackout=
s=20
was California.=20
Taking note of the ISO's study, the council was far more pessimistic about=
=20
the levels of available power this summer from California's existing=20
hydroelectric, nuclear and natural gas-fired generating plants. It also=20
predicted fewer imports from out of state and said California will get less=
=20
power than expected from the host of new power plants scheduled to begin=20
operation over the summer.=20
The council did say the demand for power is likely to be less than the ISO=
=20
estimated, thanks to the impact of conservation programs and a hefty rate=
=20
increase approved by the Public Utilities Commission. But the council said=
=20
conservation programs are likely to generate only a third of the savings=20
predicted by state officials.=20
California has experienced six days of rolling blackouts this year, includi=
ng=20
two last week, the result of hydropower shortages, unexpected plant shutdow=
ns=20
and the financial crisis facing the state's two main utilities, Pacific Gas=
=20
and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison.=20
The second blackout, on Jan. 18, was the most widespread, cutting power to=
=20
750,000 homes at a time.=20
The reliability council said the average blackout this summer will be twice=
=20
as bad, taking down 1.6 million homes at a time.=20
Predicting the impact of summertime blackouts has become something of a=20
cottage industry, with various independent consultants forecasting billions=
=20
in economic losses. Recently a consultant hired by top business lobbyists=
=20
said the state will lose 135,000 jobs if it suffers 110 hours of blackouts =
--=20
less than half as many hours as predicted by the reliability council, which=
=20
is owned by 10 Regional Reliability Councils whose members come from all=20
segments of the electric industry.=20
The effect on the business climate remains to be seen. ""We really have no=
=20
experience with this,"" said chief economist Ted Gibson of the California=20
Department of Finance.=20
Various industry analysts have predicted anywhere from 20 to 36 days of=20
rolling blackouts this summer. The ISO has said the state could face=20
blackouts any day when total demand exceeds 40,000 megawatts, which happene=
d=20
34 times last summer.=20
The ISO, which is scheduled to update its summer forecast next week, didn't=
=20
predict the number of hours of blackouts. But the reliability council fed=
=20
ISO's assumptions into its computer model and came up with 55 hours of=20
blackouts this summer. Using its own, more pessimistic assumptions, the=20
council estimated 260 hours, or about 15 hours a week.=20
""It wouldn't shock me,"" said Severin Borenstein of the University of=20
California Energy Institute. ""It's a little high, compared to the other=20
estimates, but there's a lot of uncertainty about what's going to be=20
available in state and out of state.""=20
The ISO had no comment on the council's projections, but Davis' office said=
=20
the forecast is overly pessimistic.=20
""Their calculations are based on the worst conditions occurring all day,=20
every day,"" said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio.=20
He said the council overlooks the expected supplies from new ""peaker"" power=
=20
plants and two Orange County plants that will fire up this summer after fiv=
e=20
years in mothballs. The report also underestimates the level of power that=
=20
neighboring states will sell to California, he said.=20
""They assume it's going to be blazing hot in Phoenix, Portland and San=20
Francisco all on the same day (drastically reducing imports), and that neve=
r=20
happens,"" Maviglio said.=20
Davis has tried recently to minimize the impact of blackouts, saying: ""We'l=
l=20
get through the summer without major disruptions. A couple of difficult day=
s,=20
but no major disruptions.""=20
The council and the ISO are far apart in their assessment of supplies. The=
=20
ISO, for instance, predicted that the state will get nearly 2,600 additiona=
l=20
megawatts of power by July from new plants under construction, enough=20
electricity for nearly 2 million homes. The council said new plants typical=
ly=20
don't operate at full efficiency when they're starting up. Its prediction:=
=20
500 megawatts, or enough for only 375,000 homes.=20
Similarly, the ISO said the drought will curtail hydro supplies by 1,000=20
megawatts. The council said the shortfall will reach 2,400 megawatts by=20
August.=20
And while the ISO figured unexpected plant shutdowns will erase 2,500=20
megawatts of power, the council predicted the damage will be more than 4,50=

megawatts.=20

tale of political intrigue.=20
During late 2000 and early 2001, business leaders, worried that the utiliti=

repeatedly urged Gov. Gray Davis to allow utility rates to rise. The=20

How that came about is still a bit mysterious. Davis acted after the state=

?????SAN FRANCISCO--Voicing fears for the health of California's economy, t=
he=20
state's chief utility regulator Tuesday shifted some of a $5.7-billion rate=
=20
increase away from agricultural and industrial customers and placed it on=
=20
millions of residential customers, whose bills will rise $4 to $85 a month.
?????A sharply divided California Public Utilities Commission voted 3 to 2 =
to=20
approve a plan that will fundamentally change how customers of the state's=
=20
biggest utilities will pay for power. The rates are designed to reward thos=
e=20
who conserve and to punish those who don't.
?????The rate increase will begin appearing in June bills and is retroactiv=
e=20
to March 27, when the commission approved an average hike of 3 cents a=20
kilowatt-hour.
?????""Every consumer in California is justified in feeling outrage at the=
=20
rates we approve today and the bills they will have to pay tomorrow,"" said=
=20
the commission decision. ""We share the sense of outrage.""
?????Consumer groups accused the PUC of bowing to political pressure from=
=20
business interests. And business groups, which lobbied hard in recent days =
to=20
soften the hit to industry, said the PUC did not go far enough to protect t=
he=20
state's economy.
?????The plan by PUC President Loretta Lynch was revised after the governor=
=20
openly criticized it and industry leaders mounted a fierce public relations=
=20
attack.
?????The final version covering 9 million Southern California Edison and=20
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. customers called for the following:
?????* Average residential rates will rise by 47% for Edison customers who=
=20
use more than 130% of their baseline, the amount deemed necessary to meet t=
he=20
needs of a typical household. PG&E customers will experience a 55% increase=
.=20
The top rate for the heaviest users will rise 71% for Edison customers and=
=20
80% for those of PG&E. The two companies together have nearly 751,000 such=
=20
customers.
?????* A new five-tier system will be instituted for residential customers,=
=20
with rates rising as usage rises. The average bills rise less than the=20
average rates because the new rates affect only a portion of the bill.
?????* Industrial customers will see an average rate increase of 49%, which=
=20
is only slightly lower than Lynch's original proposal. But the PUC capped t=
he=20
average rates at 12.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for industrial customers of=
=20
Edison and 12.3 cents for PG&E. The cap would limit increases for some=20
industrial customers, but it was unclear Tuesday how it would be applied.
?????* In response to Democratic Gov. Gray Davis' urgings, rate increases f=
or=20
agricultural interests were capped at 15% to 20%, the smallest overall=20
increase among the customer groups.
?????* Small-business customers will see their rates rise by about 35%.
?????* Customers who use less than 130% of baseline, low-income customers a=
nd=20
people with special medical needs will have no increase.
?????The commission acted to help the state pay for the soaring price of=20
wholesale electricity. Under the deregulation of California's electricity=
=20
industry, the utilities were barred from passing along high electricity cos=
ts=20
charged by independent generators. In the process, PG&E and Edison were=20
pounded by debt, and the state was forced in mid-January to buy electricity=
=20
on their behalf.
?????The commission acknowledged that more rate increases may be necessary=
=20
unless federal regulators find a way to control the wholesale electricity=
=20
market.
?????In the six weeks after the rate increase was approved, the panel held=
=20
hearings and designed the rate structure--a process that normally takes at=
=20
least six months. A vote on the rate design was scheduled for Monday, but i=
t=20
was postponed for a day to allow commissioners to review revisions that Lyn=
ch=20
made to her proposal over the weekend.
?????By approving Lynch's plan, the commission rejected one proposed by a P=
UC=20
administrative law judge who conducted the hearings. That proposal would ha=
ve=20
resulted in lower rates for residential customers and higher rates for all=
=20
classes of business than the Lynch version.
?????The two dissenting votes were cast by Commissioners Edward Bilas and=
=20
Henry Duque, both appointees of former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson.
?????Duque criticized the plan for ""favoring some customers while punishing=
=20
others. . . . Today's decision asks small businesses and some residential=
=20
customers to subsidize others. Subsidized consumption leads to more=20
consumption, not conservation.""
?????Bilas said: ""This crippling rate increase would have a ripple effect""=
=20
through California's economy and could drive out business.
?????""What we have here is an economic recipe for disaster,"" said Bilas.
?????Commissioner Geoffrey F. Brown, a Davis appointee, tried to negotiate=
=20
more favorable treatment of industry after recently speaking with Bilas and=
=20
the governor's office. Lynch made some changes that reduced the rate increa=
se=20
for industry slightly, to about 49% on average. Brown had hoped to lower th=
e=20
increase to about 43%.
?????At the meeting Brown said he had ""great hesitancy"" about some of the=
=20
rates in Lynch's proposal but would back it.
?????""At the end of the day we need to raise the money to meet the electric=
al=20
needs of California,"" he said. ""We cannot walk away from it. We cannot put=
=20
our heads in the sand.
?????""California now has the opportunity in this time of crisis to conserve=

to break the fever, to beat back the looters.""
?????Protesters interrupted Brown and Commissioner Carl Wood, crying, ""Seiz=

California Highway Patrol officers.
?????The Utility Reform Network accused the commission of caving in to=20
business interests and said the revisions in Lynch's plan added more than=
=20
$100 million to the amount to be paid by residential customers.
?????""They put too much of the increase on the residential customers,"" said=
=20
Mike Florio, senior attorney for the group.
?????After the hearing, Brown went face-to-face with Florio in the building=

courtyard. He said the amount shifted from industry to residential customer=

was closer to $40 million and he angrily denied that industry influenced hi=

?????Edison is still assessing how the rates would affect customer bills,=
=20
said Akbar Jazayeri, director of revenue and tariffs. He noted that the new=

rates will apply only to the usage in each tier, not to the entire bill.
?????""It doesn't mean because your usage is 1,000 kilowatt-hours that your=

?????The PUC estimated that the average monthly Edison residential bill wil=

State Has Lost Global Lead in 'Green' Power=20
Electricity: As the crisis worsens, California has been overtaken on solar=
=20
and wind energy. Still, alternative producers remain key players.=20

By MITCHELL LANDSBERG, Times Staff Writer=20

?????A quarter of a century ago, California stood at the vanguard in the=20
development of alternative energy worldwide. With Gov. Jerry Brown lighting=
=20
the way--and enduring no small measure of ridicule for doing so--the state=
=20
took the lead in finding ways to coax electricity from the sun and wind,=20
underground steam and agricultural waste.
?????Today, as the state struggles with the worst electricity crisis in its=
=20
history, it is no longer the global leader in exploiting what loosely falls=
=20
under the rubric of ""green"" energy.
?????Japan now generates more than 15 times as much electricity from solar=
=20
energy as does California, despite having about half the usable sunlight.=
=20
Germany produces more than triple the wind energy.
?????And although California remains the undisputed U.S. leader in=20
alternative energy production, Texas, home of the American oil industry, is=
=20
among several states threatening to supplant its leadership by mandating th=
e=20
rapid growth of renewable power generation over the next decade.
?????Not that renewable energy has become irrelevant in California.
?????The state, in its moment of crisis, is counting on alternative=20
power--the most reliable and cheapest source of power--as never before.=20
Without the megawatts these producers pump into the grid, the odds of=20
blackouts would be even higher and the pressure to raise rates even greater=
.
?????Moreover, renewable energy producers now hold immense financial power=
=20
over the fate of the state's second-largest utility, Southern California=20
Edison. At any time, they could drag Edison into Bankruptcy Court--and have=
=20
threatened to do so--if it doesn't pay them the $500 million it owes for pa=
st=20
deliveries of electricity.
?????With their costs vastly surpassing their income, some producers have=
=20
simply shut down, draining precious megawatts from the grid. A spokeswoman=
=20
for the California Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's=
=20
power network, pegged the reduction in output by small producers Tuesday at=
=20
1,400 megawatts. About half that shortfall, she said, was due to payment=20
problems.
?????The situation has grown so severe that today the Federal Energy=20
Regulatory Commission is holding a hearing on whether to order the renewabl=
e=20
power generators back on line.
?????Leaders in the alternative energy industry--which has grown from its=
=20
techno-hippie roots to become the province of large, mainstream=20
corporations--say they are optimistic that their future will be brighter.=
=20
Eventually, they are certain, renewable energy sources will become=20
mainstream; fossil fuels--oil, coal and natural gas--will become, once agai=
n,=20
fossils.
?????And yet, for all that, here's the harsh reality: For the past decade,=
=20
alternative energy has played a shrinking role in the state's overall=20
electricity mix, and that is almost certain to accelerate as the state=20
rebounds from its crisis the old-fashioned way, by building more power plan=
ts=20
that convert fossil fuels into electricity.
?????Many in the utility industry argue that there is no choice. Most=20
alternative energy sources remain too expensive or inconvenient to play a=
=20
major role in the state's power mix now, they say.
?????In fact, leaving aside hydroelectric power, which fluctuates widely=20
during drought and flood cycles, the production of renewable energy in=20
California actually declined slightly between 1990 and 1999. During the sam=
e=20
period, the use of fossil fuels for electricity increased substantially.
?????With 13 new, conventional power plants licensed but not yet completed,=
=20
it seems certain that renewable sources of energy will provide a still=20
smaller percentage of the state's power in the next few years.
?????Those who have championed alternative energy for the past three decade=
s=20
rue the opportunity that could be lost.
?????""This state and its ratepayers invested heavily in renewable energy=20
technologies,"" said Hal Harvey, president of the Energy Foundation, a=20
nonprofit organization dedicated to encouraging sustainable energy.
?????""We paid a premium for that, but we succeeded in making these=20
technologies five, six, 10 times cheaper than they were. . . . Ironically,=
=20
this state paid for that revolution but is not taking advantage of it.""
?????If anyone needed a reminder of how far California has come in its=20
development of alternative power--and the consequences of failing to keep u=
p=20
that investment--it came in March, when alternative energy generators began=
=20
to close their plants after enduring months of missed payments by the=20
financially strapped utility companies.
?????Although the state government had spent billions picking up the=20
utilities' tab for conventional power, it too had balked at paying the smal=
l=20
alternative producers.
?????The result: the first deliberate statewide blackouts since World War I=
I.

?????A Small Step Taken in 1976
?????On May 21, 1976, a small item appeared on the back pages of the Los=20
Angeles Times.
?????""Homeowners and businesses can earn state tax credits of up to $1,000=
=20
for purchases of solar energy equipment under a bill signed by Gov. Brown,""=
=20
it said. It went on to quote the governor as saying: ""It was a small step,=
=20
but it was an important step.""
?????He might have added that it would be little noted nor long remembered.
?????Yet that small step helped nurture a budding interest in alternative=
=20
energy in California, whose native tinkerers were just then exploring ways =
of=20
reducing their reliance on the traditional electricity grid, then powered=
=20
primarily by oil, large hydroelectric plants and nuclear power.
?????Ross Burkhardt was typical. An electrician by training and a hippie by=
=20
inclination, he was living in a tepee in the hills of Mendocino County in t=
he=20
late 1970s when he and many of his friends began looking for cleaner forms =
of=20
power. Burkhardt was among those who had migrated to the rural counties nor=
th=20
of San Francisco in the hope of living a simpler, more independent=20
life--which meant, for a time, life without electricity.
?????Life without power turned out to be a bit of a drag. For one thing, it=
=20
meant life without a stereo. Burkhardt and others began stringing wires to=
=20
the batteries of their cars, trucks and vans to power their tunes and light=
s.=20
That worked for a while, until people started getting up in the morning to=
=20
find their car batteries stone dead.
?????In about 1978, Burkhardt had had enough. ""I decided to make a windmill=
=20
one day,"" he recalled. He bought an old computer tape drive motor for $20 a=
t=20
a junk shop and turned it into a generator. He used a knife to carve a=20
42-inch-long 2-by-4 into a blade, then mounted the blade and motor on a pol=
e.=20
Then he hooked up the whole mess to a truck battery.
?????Eureka! When the wind blew, the windmill turned, generating electricit=
y=20
that was fed into the battery. He was creating enough power to keep his tep=
ee=20
lighted and his stereo cranking, and he wasn't damming any rivers or=20
splitting any atoms or polluting the air. And there was a bonus, Burkhardt=
=20
said: ""It was all free!""
?????Burkhardt would later move into a somewhat more permanent home and tak=
e=20
advantage of Brown-era tax credits to buy solar panels that he is still=20
using. Others were doing the same thing and creating ever more sophisticate=
d=20
technology to maintain life off the electrical grid.
?????And the state itself was investing heavily in alternative energy. In=

Brown's first term, California allocated $23.7 million to demonstrate the=

generation. By 1980, renewable and alternative sources made up 5% of the=20
state's electricity generation.
?????At the same time, the federal government, still reeling from the Arab=
=20
oil embargo, was developing its own alternative energy policies. A federal=

law passed in 1978 required utilities to buy energy from any qualified=20
alternative producer.
?????How much to pay for alternative energy has always been an issue. Becau=

?????In 1980, Ronald Reagan was elected president. In 1982, George Deukmeji=

considerably less enamored of alternative energy than those of their=20
Democratic predecessors.
?????About the same time, the price of oil and natural gas began to drop.=

Richard Worthington, a professor of politics at Pomona College who follows=

?????9% Comes From 'Green' Sources
?????Twenty years later, California has nevertheless made major strides in=

developing alternative energy. The state now obtains about 9% of its power=

from ""green"" sources, not counting the 15% that comes from hydroelectric=20

?????Yet advocates of renewable power say California could have done much=

they say, the current crisis could have been avoided altogether with smart=

?????The Japanese, Germans and Danes, among others, have vastly increased=

their use of renewable energy by heavily subsidizing solar and wind energy=

?????Americans tend to view such policies as heavy-handed--even antithetica=

?????""I think engineers like to build big, complicated power plants,"" said=

Angelina Galiteva, director of strategic planning for the Los Angeles=20

?????It's also true that even as the prices of alternative forms of=20

?????Until last year.
?????In January 2000, wholesale electricity was averaging about 3 cents a=

A One-Two Punch in the Budget=20
Economy: Tech dive and energy crisis hurt bond ratings again. Analysts say=
=20
it's likely to get worse.=20

By MIGUEL BUSTILLO and DEBORA VRANA, Times Staff Writers=20

?????A perfect storm is brewing over California: A downturn in the state's=
=20
prized high-tech economy has coincided with a costly energy crisis, leaving=
 a=20
once-bountiful state budget a shambles.
?????The cascade of tax revenues from stock options that caused the budget =
to=20
balloon in recent years has begun to dry up as the New Economy falters. At=
=20
the same time, the energy crisis is forcing the state to spend billions=20
buying electricity to avoid crippling mass blackouts.
?????The latest bad news came Tuesday, when Moody's Investors Service becam=
e=20
the second major credit rating firm to downgrade $25 billion in state bonds=
,=20
sounding an alarm over the ""increasing financial risks associated with the=
=20
continuing energy crisis.""
?????The downgrades not only add millions to the state's borrowing costs,=
=20
including projects in the next state budget, they further complicate a=20
troubled plan to float a record $13.4 billion in bonds to repay state coffe=
rs=20
for electricity purchases.
?????The move by Moody's came one day after Gov. Gray Davis announced that =
he=20
was dipping into the state's emergency reserve fund to finance a pared-down=
=20
budget for the fiscal year that begins in July. Already, a statewide sales=
=20
tax holiday has been canceled and $300 million in aid to local governments=
=20
has been deleted from the budget.
?????The spiraling events contributed to a financial picture that looks=20
increasingly bleak, according to analysts. With the long, hot summer loomin=
g,=20
it only figures to get worse, potentially developing into the worst fiscal=
=20
crisis the state has faced since the economic recession of the early 1990s.
?????""It's almost a Kafkaesque situation we find ourselves in,"" said state=
=20
Treasurer Phil Angelides. ""California is the leading edge of the national=
=20
economy, which is the leading world economy. We have to take these current=
=20
problems with a grain of salt. But without a doubt, these downgrades are a=
=20
black mark that threatens to harm the state's reputation.""
?????After years of worrying about little more than how best to spend surpl=
us=20
billions, Gov. Gray Davis is now faced with his first tough budget battle.=
=20
And his initial response--draining emergency reserves rather than slashing=
=20
government spending--has raised eyebrows in Sacramento and on Wall Street.
?????Despite a pervasive aura of negativity, however, veteran state budget=
=20
officials profess optimism.
?????""Clearly, the revenue outlook has deteriorated,"" said Elizabeth Hill,=
=20
the state's nonpartisan legislative analyst. But compared to the budget=20
deficits of the past decade, Hill said, the current situation is still with=
in=20
control.
?????""Most of us have lived though the $14-billion budget shortfall,"" she=
=20
said, referring to the 1990-91 budget season, when then-Gov. Pete Wilson wa=
s=20
forced to slash programs. ""So we have seen us overcome serious economic=20
problems in the past.""
?????Experts on the outside, however, were taking a more negative view. In=
=20
explaining its downgrade, Moody's said it was particularly concerned that=
=20
California had recently backed out on a $4-billion loan to reimburse the=20
budget for electricity purchases until bonds could be floated, and that the=
=20
bond sale had been delayed until August.
?????It was also concerned about the general decline in the state and=20
national economies, and Davis' plan to maintain only a minimal $1-billion=
=20
reserve, the firm said. Moody's action came less than a month after Standar=
d=20
& Poor's lowered its rating on California bonds two notches.
?????The downgrade registered virtually no response on Wall Street on=20
Tuesday, in part because many bond traders and analysts have already reacte=
d=20
to California's energy woes and actually expected a harsher action from=20
Moody's. The firm lowered the rating on $19.8 billion of general obligation=
=20
bonds from AA2 to AA3. The ratings on $5.7 billion in lease revenue bonds w=
as=20
dropped from AA3 to A1.
?????In general, the lower the rating, the higher the interest the state mu=
st=20
pay those who buy its bonds. Thus, the downgrade threatens to increase the=
=20
price tag for state projects, such as $400 million in higher education bond=
s=20
Davis had proposed in his new budget.
?????""If anything, the market was surprised that Moody's was so kind,"" said=
=20
Bob Gore, a managing director and bond trader at Crowell Weedon & Co. in Lo=
s=20
Angeles. ""I thought they'd take [the state] down to at least a single-A.""
?????But it sparked a heated round of finger-pointing in Sacramento, with=
=20
Davis and other Democrats accusing Republicans of causing the state's credi=
t=20
rating to slip by blocking the loan deal last week.
?????The GOP legislators attempted to force Davis into a new strategy on th=
e=20
energy crisis by holding up a bill needed to secure the loan and sell the=
=20
bonds. But Davis refused and the Democratic-led Legislature passed a=20
majority-only bill instead.
?????""Last week, when Republican legislators decided to play politics and=
=20
block a vote on revenue bonds, I warned that their actions could have serio=
us=20
consequences,"" Davis said in a statement Tuesday. ""Today, the seeds of=20
Republican obstructionism are bearing their ugly fruit.""
?????Republicans, in turn, blamed the downgrade on Davis, calling it a=20
denunciation of his entire plan to finance a way out of the energy crisis.
?????""Last I heard we were the minority here,"" said Assemblyman George Runn=
er=20
(R-Lancaster), the GOP's budget point man in the lower house. ""He's holding=

?????Political differences over how to overcome California's financial=20

260 Hours of Summer Blackouts Predicted=20

?????WASHINGTON--California will experience up to 260 hours of electrical=

blackouts this summer, an industry group predicted Tuesday in one of the=20
gloomiest assessments of the state's energy crisis.
?????In announcing its bleak calculations, the North American Electric=20
Reliability Council said that many of the assumptions made by the agency th=
at=20
runs California's electrical transmission system appear overly optimistic.
?????That agency, the California Independent System Operator, has not made=

state could face 34 days this summer in which blackouts are possible,=20
assuming Californians use the same amount of electricity as they did last=

?????The Princeton, N.J.-based reliability council said California is likel=

to fall 4,500 to 5,500 megawatts short of peak demand each month this summe=
r.=20
In other words, at the time of day when energy use is at its highest, the=
=20
state might not be able to serve the equivalent of about 3.75 million homes=
.
?????That is consistent with Cal-ISO's calculations of what could happen in=
=20
the worst of three possible scenarios for the summer but about 1,500=20
megawatts more than the agency's most likely scenario.
?????The newest projections are far more pessimistic than those issued=20
earlier this year by Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a=20
Massachusetts-based firm that predicted about 20 hours of blackouts this=20
summer. On the other end of the spectrum, Reliant Energy, a major owner of=
=20
power plants, has quoted consultants' projections that the state faces 1,10=

?????The reliability council said the state could experience power=20
emergencies during non-peak periods as well as those of peak electricity us=
e.=20
The nonprofit corporation was formed after the 1965 blackouts in the=20
Northeast to promote electricity reliability.
?????In its 64-page assessment, the group questioned several assumptions ma=
de=20
by Cal-ISO and other analysts, including whether all of the anticipated new=
=20
electric generators will come into service in time.
?????""Since new generation requires a shakedown period during initial=20
start-up,"" the industry group said in its report, ""it is unlikely that all =
of=20
the new generation will be on schedule and 100% available.""
?????The council also projects that Californians will conserve less=20
electricity than state regulators hope--in part because of the newness of=
=20
rate increases and incentives designed to curb usage--and that the summer m=
ay=20
be warmer than normal.
?????A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis disputed the forecast, saying it assum=

the worst.
?????""We are preparing for the worst and hoping for the best,"" said the=20
spokesman, Steve Maviglio.
?????He contended that the industry group underestimates the amount of=20

?????Cal-ISO spokeswoman Lorie O'Donley did not criticize the report=20

When PG&E Corp. Chairman Robert Glynn takes the stage at San Francisco's=20
Masonic Auditorium today for the company's annual shareholder meeting, the=
=20
first thing he will do is wipe some egg off his face.=20
In his address to shareholders at the Masonic in 1998, Glynn had good news =
to=20
report about California's burgeoning efforts to deregulate the state's=20
electricity market.=20
""Electricity rates are down 10 percent from where they were a year ago,"" he=
=20
declared. ""And they are going to stay down for several years, and then they=
=20
will go down again.=20
""There is no product bought on a daily basis that has such a predictable=20
downward price trajectory,"" Glynn said.=20
Today, three years after that disastrously wrong forecast, PG&E's utility=
=20
subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric Co., is in bankruptcy court attempting=
=20
to crawl out from beneath more than $9 billion in debt -- the result of=20
soaring power prices stemming from the same deregulation scheme Glynn had=
=20
once championed.=20
Still, it's a fairly safe bet that he won't beg shareholders for their=20
forgiveness.=20
""I am not uncomfortable looking back on the positions we took,"" Glynn told=
=20
Chronicle editors and writers recently when asked about his company's role =
in=20
drafting California's 1996 deregulation law.=20
He said PG&E placed its considerable weight behind deregulation efforts=20
because it was what customers wanted, and ""we didn't want to be on the othe=
r=20
side of our customers.""=20
In fact, few if any PG&E customers fully understood=20
the highly complex legislation that ultimately would make California's=20
electricity market the most dysfunctional in the nation.=20
Rather, as a close reading of Glynn's speeches in recent years reveals, he=
=20
viewed deregulation as a prime business opportunity that would allow PG&E t=
o=20
pay off past debts and expand its operations nationwide.=20
""In effect, we are trading our monopoly in half of one state for a wide- op=
en=20
market opportunity in all 50 states,"" he told the San Francisco Commonwealt=
h=20
Club in late 1997.=20
And in his address at PG&E's 1999 shareholder meeting, Glynn said he backed=
=20
deregulation ""so that we could be solidly positioned to capture the economi=
c=20
benefits of this gigantic opening of the North American marketplace.""=20
All that changed, of course, when California's wholesale electricity prices=
=20
spiked sharply higher last summer and the state's two largest utilities, PG=
&E=20
and Southern California Edison, rapidly found themselves teetering on the=
=20
brink of financial ruin.=20
Since then, numerous other states have halted or reversed their own=20
deregulation plans, and California's experiment -- in which PG&E was ""a=20
leading force,"" according to Glynn -- is now universally held up as an obje=
ct=20
lesson in how not to restructure an electricity market.=20
To be sure, Glynn and PG&E are not solely to blame for California's current=
=20
troubles, and neither they nor anyone else could have anticipated the surge=
=20
in wholesale prices charged by out-of-state power companies.=20
""The whole structure of deregulation was put together poorly,"" said Douglas=
=20
Christopher, an energy-industry analyst at investment bank Crowell, Weedon =
&=20
Co. in Los Angeles. ""People worked with what they could, but the whole thin=
g=20
was a mess.""=20
At the same time, he said PG&E's management exacerbated the utility's=20
problems by not taking sufficient countermeasures until last December --=20
almost half a year after California's energy woes surfaced. ""That's just=20
amazing,"" Christopher said.=20
In hindsight, it has become clear that Glynn and PG&E made a series of=20
missteps that ultimately would result in the third-largest bankruptcy in U.=
S.=20
history.=20
Yet the man at PG&E's helm remains largely unknown to the millions of=20
Northern California ratepayers who write his company a check each month. An=
d=20
that's just how Glynn prefers it.=20
His own public relations people say their boss does not like to be the=20
subject of ""personality-oriented stories"" and tends not to agree to=20
interviews for profiles.=20
In his meeting at The Chronicle, Glynn, 58, shed his suit jacket and spoke=
=20
confidently about his company's bankruptcy prospects and California's energ=
y=20
problems.=20
But he declined further interviews, saying he would be too busy preparing f=
or=20

""He likes to remain private,"" one official explained, in the next breath=20

tinkerer's mentality, seeking out ways a matter can be taken apart to find=
=20

Glynn's detractors -- primarily consumer activists -- say that even if he i=

not personally responsible for California's current energy difficulties, he=

program director for the California Public Interest Research Group in=20
Sacramento. ""It has put its own shareholders so far beyond anyone else that=

Others expressed astonishment that PG&E has gone bankrupt on Glynn's watch=

Beginning in June, residential customers of California's two largest=20

And members of the state Public Utilities Commission said after Tuesday's 3=

=20
""When you look down the road we're going to have to go through this exercis=

Bilas, who argued the allocations were too hard on businesses and voted no.=
=20
""We have not solved the problem today.""=20
Tuesday's vote allocates a 3 cent rate hike the PUC approved March 27, the=
=20
largest in California history. The hike raises residential rates to an=20

The three cents, on top of a 1 cent rate increase from January made permane=

Lynch also postponed Monday's scheduled vote, saying she needed more time t=

business groups saying the rate hikes would doom California's economy and=
=20
criticisms from Gov. Gray Davis that her proposal placed too high a=20
percentage of hikes onto commercial ratepayers.=20
Mike Florio, senior attorney for The Utility Reform Network, said that extr=

businesses onto residential customers.=20
""They put too much of it on residential,"" Florio said, adding that the mone=

Jason Zeller, an analyst with the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, a consumer=

Spokesmen for both PG&E and Edison said it will take at least a day of numb=

N53504.DTL&type=3Dnews=20
Washington -- In a speech nearly seven months ago, George W. Bush revealed=
=20
the outline of the energy plan he will roll out tomorrow.=20
Bush has followed that script so closely since then that there can be few=
=20
surprises in his plan, which favors increased production of fossil fuels,=
=20
opposes wholesale electricity price caps and offers little short-term relie=
f=20
from California's deepening energy crunch.=20
Despite the White House fanfare surrounding the proposal and the months of=
=20
closed-door meetings that went into its creation, Bush mapped out the plan=
=20
during an Oct. 13 campaign speech in Michigan.=20
The outline he presented back then meshes so closely with what is known of=
=20
the new plan that it begs the question: Why did the White House go to the=
=20
trouble of creating the task force that ultimately drafted it?=20
Bush ""talked about ideas and principles and goals throughout the course of=
=20
the campaign,"" said White House spokesman Ken Lisaius. The task force, head=
ed=20
by Vice President Dick Cheney, he said, ""is taking the theme and the broad=
=20
picture of the directions we want to go into, and putting that into the=20
context of how do we do that.""=20
In his October speech, delivered to autoworkers in Pontiac, Mich., Bush sai=
d,=20
""America runs on the oil and gas and coal we gain from the Earth, and from=
=20
water held behind our dams. No matter how advanced our economy might be, no=
=20
matter how sophisticated our equipment becomes -- for the foreseeable futur=
e,=20
we will still depend on fossil fuels.""=20
To a remarkable degree, the speech foreshadowed nearly everything the=20
administration has been saying ever since about its forthcoming energy=20
policy. Even its political approach -- courting Michigan autoworkers --=20
dovetails with the new administration's courtship of unions this week to ba=
ck=20
his energy plan.=20
Accompanying the speech was a detailed outline, still available on the=20
campaign Web site, of a ""comprehensive national energy policy"" with more th=
an=20
20 initiatives to improve U.S. ""energy independence.""=20
It covers nearly every subject that has been mentioned by the White House=
=20
Energy Policy Task Force for the past four months. It specifically recommen=
ds=20
not only Bush's controversial proposal to drill in part of the Arctic=20
National Wildlife Refuge, but also, as Bush suggested Friday, to support ne=
w=20
hybrid- fuel automobiles. And it talks of encouraging more energy purchases=
=20
from Mexico and Canada, an idea Bush and Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham=
=20
have been promoting ever since.=20
Indeed, Bush's consistency -- which has repeatedly surprised Washington's=
=20
political establishment -- is nowhere more apparent than on energy policy.=
=20
That consistency has generated criticism, even from moderate Republicans,=
=20
that the new administration has turned a deaf ear to environmental concerns=
=20
and conservation, sending the White House scrambling to offset its anti-=20
environment image.=20
CALIFORNIA CRISIS
It has also opened the administration to charges that it is ignoring=20
California's worsening electricity crisis. The task force energy plan is=20
expected to focus, as Bush promised, on the long term and to contain little=
=20
that will directly address the state's blackouts.=20
Rep. Chris Cox, a Newport Beach Republican who with other California=20
Republicans was extensively briefed by Cheney on the new plan, said critics=
=20
who charge that the report is skewed too heavily toward increasing supply a=
nd=20
too little toward conservation will be surprised.=20
""I think I have as much access to it as the people who are saying those=20
things,"" Cox said, ""and I can guarantee you they haven't read it.""=20
Cox said Cheney ""has emphasized that conservation and alternative fuels are=
=20
essential elements of our 20-year strategy"" and that Bush is likely to call=
=20
for ""a tripling of reliance on on alternative fuels. So I think both the=20
criticism and the response will be improved by actually reviewing the=20
administration plan when it's released, and everything else is just=20
anticipatory.""=20
OPPOSITION TO PRICE CONTROLS
Cox also cited the administration's continuing, and apparently firm,=20
opposition to the price controls on wholesale electricity that California=
=20
Democrats, from Gov. Gray Davis on down, are asking for.=20
""On the conservation side, there is no better means of sending a strong=20
conservation signal than through the price mechanism,"" Cox said. ""I think=
=20
that precisely because conservation must be an essential element of the=20
overall solution, price controls are viewed with great skepticism.""=20
The administration said Saturday that the plan would contain tax credits fo=
r=20
""hybrid"" automobiles that run on gasoline and electricity. Last October, Bu=

San Francisco -- The largest electricity rate increase in California histor=
y=20
was adopted yesterday by state regulators after a one-day delay in which th=
e=20
burden on residential consumers was raised by more than $100 million.=20
The Public Utilities Commission split along party lines, the three Democrat=
ic=20
appointees backing the increase and the two Republicans voting against.=20
""We cannot put our heads in the sand,"" said Democratic commissioner Jeff=20
Brown amid jeers from protesters in the PUC's San Francisco meeting hall. ""=
We=20
cannot pretend that this is a problem we can walk away from.""=20
The PUC had been scheduled to vote on the increase Monday but postponed a=
=20
decision because of concerns that businesses would pay a disproportionately=
=20
large share of the nearly $6 billion to be raised from higher bills.=20
The revised measure adopted yesterday shifted about $106 million from=20
businesses and placed it squarely on the shoulders of residential consumers=
.=20
In the case of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., residential customers will see=
=20
electricity rates soar by almost 55 percent, to 22.1 cents per kilowatt hou=
r=20
from 14.3 cents.=20
But electricity rates are different from bills. Because about half of all=
=20
residential ratepayers are exempt from higher charges, overall monthly bill=
s=20
will increase by lower amounts.=20
Consumers who can stay within 130 percent of predetermined usage limits wil=
l=20
experience no increase at all.=20
Other residential customers, including most families and multiperson=20
households, will see their average monthly electricity bills rise by betwee=
n=20
6 percent and 37 percent, depending on the amount of power used.=20
The effect of higher electricity rates is mitigated somewhat because other=
=20
charges on PG&E residential bills will not change.=20
""These are the largest rate increases that I know of,"" said Paul Clanon, he=
ad=20
of the PUC's energy division and chief architect of California's new rate=
=20
structure.=20
The higher rates will take effect as of customers' June 1 power bills but=

Consumer advocates adopted a fatalistic attitude to the rate increase, whic=

""The state is going broke,"" said Mike Florio, senior attorney for The Utili=
ty=20
Reform Network in San Francisco. ""We have to get the money from somewhere.=
=20
Bankrupting the state is not an alternative.""=20
However, he said, it would have been preferable for consumers if the PUC ha=
d=20
adopted an alternative rate structure that would have cost residential=20
customers about $400 million less.=20
That alternative was never given serious consideration by the commissioners=
,=20
who focused instead on a rival proposal submitted by PUC President Loretta=
=20
Lynch.=20
Although the commissioners were acting on a rate increase of historic=20
proportions, the meeting hall took on a surreal air yesterday because three=
=20
of the five members chose to be elsewhere for the occasion. They spoke and=
=20
voted via speakerphone.=20
Lynch, who was at the Millbrae City Hall, called the rate increase=20
""unfortunate"" but said higher bills will address the state's financial=20
troubles and promote conservation.=20
She wrote in her proposal that ""every consumer in California is justified i=
n=20
feeling outrage at the rates we approve today and the bills they will have =
to=20

But Republican Commissioner Richard Bilas, speaking from the Mendocino Art=

=20
had not been fully analyzed.=20
Warning that the rate increase will lead to ""a recessionary death spiral,"" =

Bilas' Republican colleague, Henry Duque, speaking from a Texas hotel, said=
=20
the rate plan was ""incoherent"" and ""misguided"" and will do nothing to promo=
te=20
construction of much-needed new power plants.=20
PROTESTERS' TAUNTS
The only two commissioners present for yesterday's vote were Brown and his=
=20
Democratic colleague Carl Wood. They were forced to bear the brunt of taunt=

from protesters in the audience.=20
One protester, Susan Rodriguez of Oakland, was escorted from the hall by=20

""Do the right thing,"" other protesters shouted. But Brown countered that=20

Industrial power users, including many Silicon Valley stalwarts, had lobbie=

Gov. Gray Davis finally found a captain to steer his leaking ship -- the=20
complicated and politically risky plan to save Southern California Edison -=
-=20
through uncharted legislative waters.=20
Until this week, nobody in the Legislature wanted to touch Davis' secretly=
=20
negotiated agreement with Edison, which needs lawmakers' approval. It's not=
=20
that nobody cared -- almost every player in the Capitol now has an idea on=
=20
how to infuse the utility with cash, bargain down anxious creditors and avo=
id=20
the drawn-out hassles of debtors court.=20
Democratic Sen. Richard Polanco of Los Angeles, who is termed out next year=
,=20
agreed this week to carry the governor's bill, which has met with almost no=
=20
support. At least three other major proposals are circulating in the Assemb=
ly=20
and Senate, along with a desire by some lawmakers to simply let Edison go=
=20
bankrupt like Pacific Gas & Electric.=20
""There is a great sense of urgency here,"" said Brian Bennett, a spokesman f=
or=20
Edison, which supports the governor's original idea to buy the transmission=
=20
lines and infuse the company with cash. ""We can't escape the fact that we c=
an=20
be dragged into involuntary bankruptcy at any time.""=20
The outcome could determine if the energy crisis ends in months or years. I=
f=20
the Legislature and Davis can help bring financial stability to Edison, the=
n=20
the price of energy will likely fall, easing financial pressure on PG&E and=
=20
its creditors. The bankruptcy judge in the PG&E case may also scrutinize th=
e=20
Edison deal for clues.=20
""It's something that's not only important for keeping Edison out of=20
bankruptcy, but it's also an important framework and model for PG&E to get =
it=20
back on its feet,"" said Assemblyman Keith Richman, R-Northridge, who is=20
helping the GOP negotiate the Edison agreement.=20
Edison is constantly negotiating with its creditors over the huge debts it=
=20
owes to power generators that charged inflated prices last year. The state=
=20
finally took over the job of buying power in January, and has spent more th=
an=20
$6 billion so far -- money it expects to get back from a bond sale financed=
=20
by ratepayers.=20
It seems clear Davis' draft agreement with Edison is doomed as written in t=
he=20
Legislature. The governor's plan would require the state to sell more bonds=
=20
and give Edison $2.76 billion. In exchange, the state gets Edison's power=
=20
lines. The company would get a guaranteed profit of 11 percent for a decade=
=20
in order to pay off its debt, reportedly at $3.5 billion.=20
Most lawmakers hate the idea of purchasing the Edison power lines, in part=
=20
because then California would have to maintain and repair them. PG&E actual=
ly=20
has the biggest bottleneck in the power grid, so purchasing the Edison line=
s=20
would do nothing to solve that problem, Richman noted.=20
""The grid is an asset that essentially has no value to the people of=20
California or to the ratepayers,"" Richman said, ""and does nothing to bring=
=20
more electrons to the state.""=20

plan to give out-of-state power generators full credit for all the money th=
ey=20

=20
get paid.=20
-- A""Plan B"" group formed by Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks=
,=20
and which includes Assembly Republicans is looking at, among other things,=
=20
building more energy plants instead of purchasing the transmission lines.=
=20
They believe they could build enough plants to power between 2 million and =
3=20
million homes, using money dedicated from Edison ratepayers.=20
-- A plan by Assembly members Joe Nation, D-San Rafael, and John Dutra, D-=
=20
Fremont, would simply give the state an option of buying the transmission=
=20
lines, for $1.2 billion instead of $2.76 billion. Edison's parent company=
=20
would be required to contribute $400 million to the utility.=20
The Nation-Dutra plan would dedicate a larger share of each bill to paying=
=20
off debt, allowing Edison to more quickly begin buying power. ""We're trying=
=20
to find a way for the utilities to get credit worthy sooner rather than=20
later,"" Nation said. ""That will allow the state to exit the power buying=20
business.""=20
-- Some Republicans are pushing for businesses to be able to contract=20
directly for their power without going through the current state-run grid.=
=20
Businesses like the idea because they pay less for power, but Democrats say=

Millions of Californians opening their electric bills next month will see t=

biggest increase ever in residential electric rates as regulators try to=20
shore up the state's failing energy system.=20
After several delays this month, a divided California Public Utilities=20
Commission voted 3-2 to raise rates across the board, saying it was necessa=
ry=20
to keep the lights on in California. The increase follows a 10 percent hike=
=20
approved in January.=20
Residential customers will see their bills rise an average of 7 percent to =
37=20
percent, depending upon their usage, while small commercial users will see=
=20
their bills climb an average of about 37 percent.=20
The new rate plan, which goes into effect June 1, was the result of=20
last-minute jockeying by commissioners and staffers in Gov. Gray Davis'=20
office to try to bring down rates for industrial and agricultural users.=20
In the end, no one came away happy. The commission lowered agricultural rat=
es=20
before the vote, but farmers will still pay rates that are 15 to 20 percent=
=20
higher. Industrial and large commercial users got almost no last-minute=20
reprieve and will see bills spike an average of about 49 percent.=20
Residential users saw their rates jump at the last minute. They are now=20
divided into two camps: those who can keep usage at or near baseline levels=
=20
and those who cannot. Energy misers and small households will get no=20
increase. But homes where usage soars past the baseline could see their bil=
ls=20
climb by 37 percent.=20
``This is a sad day for 34 million Californians and the California economy,=

said Carl Guardino of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group. ``The PUC has=

Some residential customers are worried.=20

th=20
when the increase shows up in bills.=20
``I don't think that's fair,'' said McCrary. ``Between this and the natural=

gas increases, I'm looking at a PG&E bill that is double overall, which is =
50=20
percent of my mortgage. That's not equitable.''=20
9 million customers=20
The plan affects about 9?million customers of the state's two largest=20
utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison.=20
The rate increase will generate more than $5 billion for the utilities.=20
Regulators will decide in the coming weeks whether all of that money should=
=20
go to the state -- which has been buying power for the financially troubled=
=20
utilities -- or whether some should go to the utilities to help pay bills.=
=20
The commission vote fell along party lines, with Democrats Loretta Lynch,=
=20
Jeff Brown and Carl Wood voting for the new rate structure, and Republicans=
=20
Henry Duque and Richard Bilas voting against it.=20
Wood said he regretted having to raise rates at all. But the increased cost=
=20
of wholesale electricity left the commission with no alternative, he said.=
=20
``There is no justice in any decision we can come up with because the=20
underpinnings -- the paying of these wholesale prices -- are unjust,'' Wood=
=20
said.=20
The vote came amid jeers from protesters, who wore black to mourn the death=
=20
of the California economy.=20
As Wood did, Brown blamed the higher prices on energy wholesalers, who he=
=20
said are gouging Californians.=20
``I hear you when you say there will be pain and suffering,'' Brown said.=
=20
``But unfortunately, the wholesale prices have put us in an untenable=20
situation. We cannot put our head in the sand.''=20
Duque and Bilas were harshly critical of the rate plan, saying it placed to=
o=20
big a burden on businesses. Bilas said the residential increases were not b=
ig=20
enough and would do little to help the commission achieve its stated goal o=
f=20
encouraging conservation. At the same time, he argued, the higher rates wou=

send the state's economy into a ``recessionary death spiral.''=20
``We risk plunging the state back into the same recessionary conditions wit=

high commercial rates that set the stage for electric restructuring in the=
=20
first place,'' Bilas said. ``History will repeat itself. Businesses will fl=
ee=20
the state or shut down entirely. This means jobs and taxes are lost.''=20
Duque said he was troubled by the ``moral'' implications of the new rate=20
structure and the way that it penalizes heavy energy users.=20
``In my view, the new rate design assumes that the consumption of energy is=
 a=20
moral decision between good and bad,'' Duque said. ``The decision has a cle=

morality. All businesses and residential customers who consume more=20
electricity are bad.''=20
Last-minute lobbying by business interests appeared to have little effect.=

Davis, who had been lobbied heavily by business groups, called upon Brown t=

=20
vote.=20
``While the PUC's revised rate increase made some modest improvements, my=

Tensions surrounding the rate hike had been building up to Tuesday's vote.=
=20
After the vote, emotions spilled over into the plaza outside the commission=

BY DANA HULL=20

Mercury News=20


The electrical rate hike plan approved Tuesday by the PUC is designed to=20
reward conservation and punish heavy users. The new rate plan, which goes=
=20
into effect June 1, creates five levels, or tiers, of billing. Households=
=20
that stay within 130 percent of their ``baseline'' level of use will face n=
o=20
increase at all.=20
What is the baseline?=20
The baseline is considered a minimum level of use based on regional and=20
seasonal averages. It was set up to make sure that residential consumers we=
re=20
provided the minimum amount of electricity necessary at the lowest possible=
=20
price. Customers are charged one price for baseline use and a higher price=
=20
for electricity that is over the baseline amount.=20
Is the baseline the same for everyone?=20
No. PG&E's residential customers are assigned different baselines because t=
he=20
climate and elevation of Northern California vary so widely. The Bay Area i=
s=20
roughly divided into three climatic territories: the coastal areas includin=
g=20
San Francisco and the Peninsula; the East Bay and the South Bay; and the=20
Santa Cruz Mountains. You can best determine your baseline by checking your=

Climate zones often cut through counties: In Santa Clara County, the=20

In Alameda County, the Central Valley portion east of the Altamont Pass has=
 a=20

So do people who live in hot places like Fresno or Bakersfield get a higher=
=20
baseline than someone who lives in San Jose?=20
Yes. San Jose's electricity baseline is 324 kilowatt-hours per 30 days in t=

summer. In the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, where it is much cooler, the=
=20
summer baseline is 192. The warmer Merced and Fresno area is 468, while=20
Bakersfield has the highest baseline at 498.=20
Is the baseline the same all year?=20
No. There is a winter baseline and a summer baseline. The summer baseline=
=20
went into effect May?1, and the winter baseline goes into effect Nov.?1. .=
=20
How can I find my baseline on my bill?=20
The electric portion of your bill shows the baseline amount in kilowatt-hou=
rs=20
and the rate you are billed for that amount.=20
It also shows how much power you used over the baseline and the rate you we=
re=20

I try to conserve, but I'm always over my baseline. Are the baselines set l=
ow=20
on purpose? Does anybody stay below their baseline?=20
PG&E estimates that about 35 percent of their customers will not have to pa=
y=20
higher rates because they always stay within 130 percent of their baseline.=
=20
I am in poor health and need to use a lot of electricity for my medical=20
device. Is there any kind of medical exemption?=20
Yes. PG&E says that 48,000 customers are on Medical Baseline Service. These=
=20
customers receive an extra amount of electricity in addition to their=20
baseline each month, but pay for it at baseline rates. Customers with great=
er=20
needs can negotiate for extra electricity with the utility. Call PG&E at=20
(800)-743-5000 and ask for a Medical Baseline application.=20
I work at home. Can I call PG&E and ask for a bigger baseline?=20
No. Though many consumers who have home offices find it hard to stay within=

This is the first in a three-part series examining the Northeast's debate=
=20
over three key issues: generation, transmission and environment. How the=20
region deals with these issues could become a model for the rest of the=20
country.

All politics are local. That's what the late Speaker of the U.S. House of=
=20
Representatives Thomas P. ""Tip"" O'Neill liked to say. Given recent energy=
=20
industry events in his native Northeast, O'Neill would probably see little=
=20
reason to say otherwise.


So when the Bush administration's national energy policy is released, it wi=
ll=20
face its first trial in the court of local opinion. Recent debate in the=20
Northeast on three key issues of local and national importance=01*generatio=
n,=20
transmission and the environment=01*may suggest how the wider discussion ma=
y=20
unfold across the U.S.=20

On these three issues local politics in the Northeast are driving decisions=
=20
having broad regional implications. Local politics also are evident as=20
nascent wholesale power markets challenge the way states deal with common=
=20
issues.=20

Political strains may soon show through if power shortages hit parts of the=
=20
Northeast this summer. A relatively benign summer power outlook issued=20
earlier this month by the Northeast Power Coordinating Council (NPCC) may=
=20
mask larger issues. In its assessment, NPCC said the region=01*which stretc=

=20
surplus capacity during the peak week for demand, expected around July 15.=
=20
EXPECTED LOAD AND CAPACITY FORECASTS=20
SPREADSHEEThttp://public.resdata.com/ei_departments/lead/load_forecast.xls
However, the details show a less certain picture. NPCC forecasts 4,900 MW o=
f=20
excess capacity, but says 4,000 MW of that is locked up in Quebec and the=
=20
Canadian Maritime provinces where transmission bottlenecks will block most =
of=20
that extra power from reaching U.S. markets. The U.S. portion of NPCC could=
=20
end up with no more than 1,000 MW of reserve capacity at a time when peak=
=20
demand is expected to reach 54,000 MW.=20

Existing transmission lines across parts of New York state are all but maxe=
d=20
out and can't be relied on to deliver much additional power to New York Cit=
y.=20
Transmission constraints mean that some 80% of New York City's power needs=
=20
(and 98% of Long Island's) must be met through local generation. In testimo=
ny=20
before a legislative panel in March, New York Public Utility Commission Cha=
ir=20
Maureen O. Helmer said that if summer temperatures reach levels hit in July=
=20
1999, demand in New York City alone could top 11,000 MW and outstrip=20
available supplies by more than 850 MW.=20

Unlike California, where little generating capacity was added during the=20
1990s, new power plants are being built in the Northeast. But new plants ar=
e=20
only part of the equation. Transmission line owners say they lack financial=
=20
incentives to upgrade connections to help ensure that newly built, low-cost=
=20
plants are dispatched. Transmission congestion in New England has risen=20
sharply since 1999 and is expected to double in and around Boston by 2005.=
=20
""If there's a bottleneck, then the cheapest power plant may not be=20
dispatched,"" said Ian Davis, vice president of transmission for National Gr=
id=20
USA, which controls roughly 30% of New England's transmission network.=20

These issues and others will resonate across the U.S. and Canada as=20
politicians, utility executives, special interest groups and consumers look=
=20
for a balance among rising electric demand, environmental and lifestyle=20
protection and the need to make a buck.=20

Binary world
Here's the irony: In its simplest form, today's digital economy relies on=
=20
binary computer code to either turn a system ""on"" or ""off."" As demand for=
=20
power grows, the options for electric power appear increasingly binary, too=
.=20

""You can build a transmission line and a power plant, or sweat in the dark,=
""=20
said Doug Logan, principal with RDI Consulting. ""Take your pick.""=20

Energy's current calculus values local opinion greatly when it comes to pow=
er=20
plant and transmission line siting, and on issues related to the environmen=
t.=20
That makes it tough for regional and national points of view to be heard.=
=20
This, in turn, affects efforts to set up regional energy markets and=20
reinforce the grid, among other things.=20

Local groups vowing ""not in my back yard"" have scuttled power plant and=20
transmission line plans, including Cisco Systems' successful effort to bloc=
k=20
a power plant proposed for its Silicon Valley corporate park. On the=20
environmental front, states appear willing to adopt strict measures, even i=
f=20
they risk part of their generating capacity. Recent rules in Massachusetts=
=20
targeted six in-state power plants, whose output accounts for fully 40% of=
=20
the state's electric generation.=20

""Siting always comes down to very local issues,"" said National Grid's Davis=
.=20
""These projects move from bad news to worse news to slightly better news.""=
=20

In late March, the Connecticut Siting Board voted 7-1 to reject TransEnergi=
e=20
U.S. Ltd.'s proposal to build a $125 million, 330-MW transmission cable=20
beneath the waters of Long Island Sound to Long Island, N.Y. Though the Lon=
g=20
Island Power Authority had identified the project as critical to improving=
=20
its access to off-island power supplies, the Connecticut Board said the lin=
e=20
would have little, if any, direct benefit to Connecticut and rejected it.=
=20

""It's hard to imagine a decision more parochial,"" said Ashley Brown,=20
executive director of the Harvard Electricity Policy Group. The siting boar=
d=20
""didn't look at the benefits to New York or the region.""=20

In April, Massachusetts Gov. Jane Swift announced new power plant emission=

time=20
at the state level=01*carbon dioxide. One source said the rules move away f=

assertiveness. ""It's incongruous,"" the source said. ""As we're getting large=
r=20
competitive markets, we see legislatures becoming more specific"" in writing=
=20
emission control rules.=20

Also in April, a report by New York State Electric & Gas Corp. (NYSEG)=20
criticized a statewide assessment by the New York Independent System Operat=
or=20
(ISO) on issues including power plant siting. The plant permitting process=
=20
has not worked, NYSEG said. ""Delayed in-service dates for new generation ar=
e=20

=20
including lengthy project reviews and local lawsuits designed to block=20
projects.=20

No doubt, introducing competition, establishing new political orders and=20
restructuring markets are proving to be tough. And the process still has a=
=20
long way to go.=20

Frontier politics
But if power politics in the Northeast appears confused and unsettled,=20
consider that the region's history of cooperation on energy issues is uniqu=
e=20
in the U.S., a legacy of its tight power pool structure. On this score the=
=20
region may stand a better chance than elsewhere of working out compromises.=
=20
In Mississippi and Wisconsin, one source said, transmission lines march to=
=20
the state line and stop, their step across the frontier blocked by politica=
l=20
decisions on the other side.=20

One sticking point in the Northeast, and elsewhere, has been the slow pace =
at=20
which competitive markets appear to be evolving, particularly in terms of=
=20
adopting new approaches to help markets operate smoothly.=20

For example, transmission systems were designed to move power from one=20
utility's power plants to its load center, a straightforward and largely=20
local function. The rise of wholesale power markets strains this model by=
=20
adding expectations that the lines will also carry power from independent=
=20
power producers to more distant load centers.=20

This new use taxes existing lines and complicates the issue of who gets=20
transmission access when. It also raises local bugaboos over sacrificing=20
Farmer Jones' cornfield for a new transmission line, which may have little =
if=20
any tangible local benefit. Just this sort of local environmental issue san=
k=20
TransEnergie's Long Island Sound proposal in March when environmentalists=
=20
pointed to potential risks to local shellfish beds.=20

""A significant need exists to reinforce the grid to keep up with wholesale=
=20
sales as well as local load growth,"" said Joseph S. Graves, a member of=20
Washington, D.C.-based PA Consulting's management group. In a paper publish=
ed=20
earlier this year, the company concluded transmission is the industry's=20
weakest link, having changed the least relative to the rest of the industry=
.=20
The report also called for a series of investment incentives to encourage=
=20
more investment in transmission infrastructure.=20

""Until the health of the transmission sector is improved, the entire electr=
ic=20
power industry will underperform,"" the report said.=20

Underperformance could extend to generating assets, which should have ranke=
d=20
among the Northeast's shining accomplishments. After all, the region is one=
=20
of the few places building toward a capacity surplus, and surplus is viewed=
=20
by many as the key to achieving workable wholesale power markets.=20

Incremental change
But transmission constraints and a lack of incentives to expand the grid ma=
y=20
hurt power plant developers' efforts to provide new, low-cost,=20
environmentally friendly capacity.=20

""Our strategy is to find financial incentives to deliver additional value t=
o=20
customers and our shareholders,"" said National Grid's Davis. ""Competitive=
=20
markets mean greater uncertainty. The incentives encourage us to look for=
=20
incremental changes that deliver value quickly, rather than build grand=20
schemes that rely on paybacks over 40 years.""=20

Since wholesale markets opened in 1999, Davis has seen high levels of=20
transmission congestion in New England, which he says deter efforts to get=
=20
the most economical power to customers. Congestion affects Boston and=20
northeastern Massachusetts in particular. There, incumbent power generators=
=20
have a competitive advantage as a result, and perhaps an unwillingness to s=
ee=20
competitors enter the constrained market, Davis said. Even so, getting new=
=20
capacity sited can be a problem, whether in Massachusetts or elsewhere.=20

Choke point
In its report last month complaining about local permitting regulations bas=
ed=20
on a recent market assessment by the New York ISO, NYSEG said the ISO=20
""unrealistically"" assumed 8,600 MW of new generation could be built in the=
=20
state by 2005. ""Actual experience has shown it can take this long to work=
=20
through the ineffective and inefficient licensing process.""=20

The siting problem may not be entirely local. A power developer active in t=
he=20
region said federal agencies present more of a choke point. In proposing th=
e=20
now hotly contested 1,080-MW Athens generating station near the Hudson Rive=
r=20
in New York state, PG&E National Energy Group needed approval from the=20
state's siting board, as well as from the Federal Energy Regulatory=20
Commission, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Army Corps of=20
Engineers, the Federal Aviation Administration, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife=20
Service and the Coast Guard.=20

""There's no one-stop shopping"" and time limitations do not exist at the=20
federal level, said Dan Whyte, director of permitting for the Bethesda,=20
Md.-based developer. The developer applied for a permit from the Corps of=
=20
Engineers in February 1999 and, as of early May, was still waiting. ""That=
=20
could not happen at the state level"" where permits were issued a year ago,=
=20
Whyte said.=20

Indeed, New York state's system gives its siting board 12 months to reach a=
=20
yea or nay decision; 18 months if circumstances warrant more deliberation.=
=20
Plus, the New York system has strict rules of evidence and tight requiremen=
ts=20
to determine who can intervene, standards that don't exist at the federal=
=20
level.=20

""We have 31 plants in 19 states and each of those states has a defined=20
process for power plant siting,"" Whyte said. The federal government ""does n=
ot=20
have a coordinated process.""=20

That may change under the Bush administration's proposed energy policy. Par=
t=20
of the proposed policy may include legislation extending federal eminent=20
domain powers to transmission lines as well as natural gas pipelines. Wheth=
er=20
a coordinated approach results from the administration's energy policy=20
remains to be seen. What is clear, however, is that state governments and=

PG&E, State Regulators Spar in Court



By MICHAEL LIEDTKE
AP Business Writer




SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Contending California regulators are
illegally seeking billions of dollars that should be paid to its
creditors, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. urged a federal bankruptcy
judge to dismantle the accounting framework insulating the
utility's customers from additional electricity price increases.


Looking to guard its turf, the California Public Utilities
Commission portrayed its actions as legal maneuvers protected from
federal government interference under the U.S. Constitution.


The 2{-hour bout of arguments Monday before U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Dennis Montali represented the first major legal showdown in
PG&amp;E's bankruptcy case _ the largest ever filed by a utility.


After peppering attorneys from both sides with tough questions,
Montali took the matter under submission without providing a
timetable for issuing a decision.


The complex issue centers on arcane sections of the U.S.
bankruptcy code that could sway the balance of power in PG&amp;E's case
and determine whether the utility's 4.6 million customers _ or more
than 150,000 creditors _ absorb the costs underlying an estimated
$13 billion in wholesale electricity purchases made from June 2000
through March 2002.


As part of the 1998 deregulation of California's electricity
market, PG&amp;E's retail rates were to remain frozen through March
2002 or whenever the utility pooled enough money from above-market
rates and asset sales to pay for unprofitable investments made
during its long history as a regulated utility.


PG&amp;E says it cleared the hurdle for lifting the rate freeze
sometime between May 2000 and August 2000 _ around the same time
the utility's costs for wholesale electricity began to soar far
above the frozen rate charged to its customers. Between January
1998 and May 2000, PG&amp;E accumulated a $2.75 billion operating
profit from a favorable gap between its wholesale costs and retail
rates for electricity.


The utility said it could have proved its case for lifting the
rate freeze and passing on its electricity costs if the PUC hadn't
adopted new accounting guidelines March 27 _ 10 days before PG&amp;E
filed for bankruptcy. Besides changing the accounting rules
governing the rate freeze, the PUC's March 27 order also authorized
average price increases of up to 40 percent for households and up
to 52 percent for businesses.


PG&amp;E says those increases _ expected to begin showing up in June
electricity bills _ still aren't enough to recoup its costs.

WASHINGTON, May 15 -- The tiny staff of the Bush administration's Energy=20
Development Task Force is led by two former aides to Senator Frank H.=20
Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who is the chairman of the Senate Energy=
=20
Committee. The aides jokingly call themselves the Alaska jihad.=20
But Mr. Murkowksi, when asked recently about the role his former aides,=20
Andrew Lundquist and Karen Knutson, have played in the task force's=20
much-anticipated report, which will be released on Thursday, replied, ''The=
y=20
don't tell me anything.''=20
On the eve of the release of the 170-page report, the broad outlines are=20
fairly well known. The plan encourages the production of oil, gas, coal and=
=20
nuclear power and calls for some tax credits for renewable energy resources=
=20
and a push for conservation. But since the task force's work began in=20
February, most of Washington has remained in the dark about how it operated=
,=20
which arguments it embraced and how it reached decisions on some of the=20
nation's thorniest energy issues.=20
Individuals from the task force have met with more than 400 people from mor=
e=20
than 150 groups over the last three months. Mr. Lundquist said today that h=
e=20
could not provide a list of all the groups he had spoken with. ''I can't=20
really tell you who, because there are hundreds I've met with,'' he said.=
=20
Administration officials also said that they wanted to keep private the lis=
t=20
of those they met with to encourage the free flow of ideas. Still, they sai=
d=20
that they had talked with a broad range of interested parties.=20
In a recent interview, Vice President Dick Cheney said: ''The staff of our=
=20
energy task force has spent time with folks from various pieces, parts, of=
=20
the industry. We've also spent time with the environmentalists. I spent a l=
ot=20
of time with members of Congress, listening to them, both parties, on energ=
y.=20
So the idea that somehow only the energy industry has access just simply=20
isn't true.''=20
But last month, two Democrats on Capitol Hill challenged the secrecy of the=
=20
process surrounding the task force, which has met eight times in the last 9=
0=20
days. David S. Addington, counsel to the vice president, responded that it=
=20
did not have to provide information about the process because all of the=20
staff members are federal employees. In addition, environmental groups have=
=20
requested documentation about task force meetings under the Freedom of=20
Information Act, but so far those have been denied.=20
Democrats and environmentalists say the process was tilted heavily toward t=
he=20
coal, gas and oil industries and point out that the energy industry is one =
of=20
the biggest contributors to political campaigns, giving $64 million last=20
year, three-fourths of it to Republicans.=20
Among those who said they felt shut out was the Consumer Federation of=20
America, the nation's largest consumer-advocacy group. Howard Metzenbaum, a=
=20
Democrat and former senator from Ohio who is now chairman of the group, sai=
d,=20
''The energy crisis is first and foremost a price crisis affecting consumer=
s.=20
''It's an incredible insult to the consumers of this country that, to the=
=20
best of my knowledge, none of the consumer organizations were invited to th=
e=20
meetings or otherwise participated,'' he said.=20
Juleanna Glover Weiss, Mr. Cheney's spokeswoman, said no invitations were=
=20
issued and groups had to request meetings. ''We didn't invite anybody to me=
et=20
with us,'' she said.=20
The leaders of about two dozen environmental groups had asked to see Mr.=20
Cheney, whose office turned down their requests. Instead, midlevel staff=20
members from the groups met with Mr. Lundquist and Ms. Knutson.=20
Alys Campaigne, legislative director of the National Resources Defense=20
Council, said that that meeting lasted about 40 minutes but that the size o=
f=20
the group inhibited substantive policy discussion.=20
''We asked who the deputies were on different issues so we could have more=
=20
in-depth conversations, and they wouldn't tell us,'' she said. ''They said,=
=20
'Just send us paper, we'll take a look at it.' The meeting felt like window=
=20
dressing for us, but they got to check off the box that they consulted with=
=20
stake-holders.''=20
Mr. Lundquist said he viewed his meeting with the environmental groups as '=
'a=20
good conversation.''=20
Some of the industry representatives who did get audiences with the vice=20
president said the task force's deliberations seemed a mystery to them, too=
.=20
John Grasser, a spokesman for the National Mining Association, said: ''We'v=
e=20
probably had as much input as anybody else in town.'' But, he added, ''All =
we=20
know is what we read in the paper. This is a tight-lipped process. I have t=
o=20
take my hats off to them -- they've been able to keep a lid on it.''=20
Richard S. Shapiro, senior vice president of the Enron Corporation, a major=
=20
Republican contributor and the nation's largest trader of wholesale=20
electricity and natural gas, said top executives from his firm spent half a=
n=20
hour with Mr. Cheney, but he could not tell how much this may have influenc=
ed=20
the final report.=20
''Energy issues are a very high priority, and we've had the opportunity to=
=20
provide some input into the process,'' Mr. Shapiro said. ''But it's been=20
difficult to get input in the task force. Other consumer groups have been=
=20
weighing in with perspectives. It's not an open-hearing setting.''=20
Tom Kuhn, head of the Edison Electric Institute, the utility lobbying group=
,=20
and a friend of the president's since they were classmates at Yale, saw the=
=20
process as relatively open.=20
''The task force put out the word they were open to input,'' he said in an=
=20
interview. He said that his group sent them reports and that some executive=
s=20
met briefly with Mr. Cheney.=20
Given all of their interaction with so many groups, Mr. Lundquist denied th=

the process had been secretive. ''I don't think that's fair,'' he said.=20
''There's been no attempt to make it a secret process. All it's been is an=

California's mounting electricity expenditures are putting the state on a=
=20
slippery slope that could lead to a cash crunch later this year.=20
And even if the nation's most economically important state is able to arres=
t=20
the slide by raising billions of dollars in bonds as it currently=20
anticipates, residents will still face spiraling electricity rates and a=20
mountain of state debt that will affect them for years to come.
That is the grim assessment of credit analysts and even the state treasurer=
,=20
who is attempting to assess the long-term costs of a three-year-old=20
experiment in electricity deregulation that has gone badly awry. Sums up Ri=
ch=20
Raphael, a credit analyst at Fitch: ""The situation is serious, and the stat=
e=20
is taking on more and more risk.""=20
Yesterday, Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered its ratings on $25.5=20
billion of state of California bonds, citing ""substantial revenue=20
deterioration"" caused by the state's slowing economy and ""financial risks""=
=20
posed by state electricity woes. Last month, Standard & Poor's Ratings Grou=
p=20
took a similar step, shortly after the state's biggest investor-owned=20
utility, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. sought bankruptcy-court protection.=20
Moody's action lowered the rating on $19.8 billion worth of general=20
obligation bonds to Aa3 from Aa2 and $5.7 billion in lease revenue bonds to=
=20
A1 from Aa3.=20
Moody's says it believes that by August the state treasury will have spent=
=20
$10 billion for power, but it conceded that a blackout on pricing informati=
on=20
imposed by state officials means estimates are partly guesswork. Raymond=20
Murphy, an analyst in Moody's public-finance group, said ""not very much""=20
information has been given to his unit detailing state expenditures for=20
electricity. This is unusual, both because the state is a public entity and=
=20
because credit-rating agencies usually are given full access to internal da=
ta=20
by clients.=20
The state has been the largest buyer of electricity in the nation since=20
January, when runaway wholesale power costs outstripped the purchasing=20
ability of the state's biggest investor-owned utilities, Edison=20
International's Southern California Edison unit and PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Ga=
s=20
& Electric unit. To date, the state has allocated $6.8 billion for=20
electricity purchases.=20
How much the state is paying daily for electricity isn't clear. Since April=
,=20
the state Department of Water Resources, which is purchasing power on behal=
f=20
of the utilities, has enforced a ban on the public release of cost=20
information.=20
It pressured the California Independent System Operator to suspend posting =
of=20
that information on the ISO's Web site. In a letter sent to the ISO, Water=
=20
Resources Deputy Director Ray Hart said ""premature disclosure"" of price dat=
a=20
""disadvantages"" the state in its quest to buy electricity at the lowest cos=
t.=20
At the time, out-of-state generators were being paid an average of $520 per=
=20
megawatt hour for power supplied to the state grid operator.=20
In a Sunday television interview, Mr. Davis said the state last week paid a=
s=20
much as $1,900 per megawatt hour for power.=20
If California is paying that kind of price very often, it spells big troubl=
e=20
for the state's ability to replenish its coffers. Last week, the state=20
Legislature approved a plan to issue a record $13.4 billion in revenue bond=
s,=20
but they can't be issued before mid-August. If there is further delay, says=
=20
State Treasurer Philip Angelides, the state will have ""significantly=20
depleted"" the funds it can tap internally.=20
Indeed, Mr. Angelides says the state will have enough internal resources to=
=20
meet its power-purchase obligations through the fall only if average spot=
=20
prices are no higher than $195 per megawatt hour during the critical=20
July-through-September time period. If daily prices are substantially highe=
r=20
than that, ""they will bust the plan,"" he says. The result, credit analysts=
=20
fear, would be a liquidity crisis. The state would have essentially run out=
=20
of money before receiving bond proceeds needed to repay the general fund.=
=20
Complicating matters is an expected sharp drop in tax receipts. The state=
=20
said it expects annual revenue to decline by $3.2 billion for fiscal 2002,=
=20
the first drop since 1992.=20
Some people disagree that the state is substantially at risk. S. David=20
Freeman, an energy adviser to Mr. Davis, says the state is following a=20
""sensible plan"" to stretch out power costs into future years, when they are=
=20
expected to drop substantially. Mr. Freeman argues that higher rates will=
=20
prompt greater conservation, reducing the amount of money the state has to=
=20
spend. ""All this stuff about the economy going under is a bunch of hogwash,=
""=20
Mr. Freeman says.

?????Economists say that sort of pattern, in which rising energy costs ripp=

of the 1990s.
?????""The argument can be made that higher energy prices are really importa=

?????Still, Leamer said the economy is much less dependent on energy today=

than it was at the time of past oil-price-related downturns.
?????The effect is particularly limited in California, some economists say,=
=20
because the state is the second-lowest user of electricity per capita among=

Davis Turns Up the Heat on Supplier=20
Power: Reliant Energy says escalating rhetoric might be leading toward=20
seizure of a plant.=20

By DAN MORAIN and NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writers=20

?????SACRAMENTO--After months of broadly vilifying California's energy=20
suppliers, Gov. Gray Davis has launched a new offensive, taking aim at a=20
single firm: Houston-based Reliant Energy, whose executives believe the=20
governor may be building a case to confiscate the company's power plants.
?????Intensifying his assault, Davis on Wednesday called Reliant=20
""obstructionist."" He warned that actions taken by Reliant and other=20
independent generators this summer will determine whether he signs a windfa=
ll=20
profits tax bill or, in the extreme, commandeers the electricity produced b=
y=20
a plant or seizes the facility itself.
?????""I've made clear to the generators that they can influence my decision=
,""=20
Davis said in an interview. ""We have a very tough summer ahead of us. We ne=
ed=20
their full cooperation. . . . I reserve the right to do what is in the=20
state's best interest. I think it is fair to say that Reliant is not off to=
 a=20
good start.""
?????Earlier in the day, after signing a bill creating a power authority in=
=20
California, the governor warned electricity suppliers: ""If they don't want =
to=20
see their plants seized, they should make sure their plants are up and=20
running this summer.""
?????The increasingly hostile barbs have grabbed Reliant's attention. Some=
=20
executives believe they are being set up by the administration--for what,=
=20
they're not sure. But the company is reviewing contingency plans, ranging=
=20
from what plant operators should do if their facilities are picketed and wh=
o=20
they should call if state officials show up unannounced.
?????""We would hope,"" Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley said, ""that=20
draconian measures and political rhetoric and finger-pointing would not be=
=20
pursued. But there is a history of confiscatory actions, including seizure =
of=20
power contracts with other companies.""
?????Earlier this year, Davis used his emergency authority to seize long-te=
rm=20
power contracts that Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric=
=20
had signed with power sellers. Those contracts were about to be auctioned b=
y=20
California's power market to reimburse generators owed money by the hobbled=
=20
utilities.
?????By seizing the contracts--estimated to be worth nearly $1 billion--Dav=
is=20
was able to ensure that power would be sold to California at relatively low=
=20
prices, rather than resold on the costlier spot market. Under his emergency=
=20
authority, Davis could use the same tactic to seize power plants, or the=20
power produced by the facilities.
?????But such an act would pose huge risks. Perhaps most troublesome, other=
=20
private companies might react by pulling investments out of California or, =
in=20
the case of out-of-state generators, stop sales here.
?????Still, as the power crisis worsens and public frustration grows, calls=
=20
for the governor to seize power plants have become more intense.
?????""Sooner or later,"" Senate President Pro Tem John Burton said Wednesday=
,=20
""we've got to let these buccaneers know that we're not going to tolerate wh=
at=20
they're doing to us. The only thing these exploiters would understand is=20
possibly a little counterterrorism.""
?????Reliant got involved in California's deregulated market in 1998, buyin=
g=20
five power plants from Edison for $292 million. Combined, the plants are=20
capable of supplying 3,700 megawatts of electricity, enough to serve 2.8=20
million homes.
?????In the first quarter of 2001, Reliant's wholesale energy sales increas=
ed=20
by 171%, producing income of $216 million, compared to a loss of $22 millio=
n=20
for the same period last year.
?????Reliant is not alone in making huge money off California's deregulatio=
n=20
debacle. Also profiting have been Duke Energy, Williams Cos., Mirant Corp.=
=20
and Dynegy Inc.--all based outside California.
?????In the past, Davis has used an assortment of inflammatory terms to=20
broad-brush the generators. He recently called them ""the biggest snakes on=
=20
the planet Earth.""
?????But Reliant in particular has drawn the governor's wrath for allegedly=
=20
being more recalcitrant than the others in working with the administration.
?????""They just want to bleed us dry,"" Davis said in his interview with The=
=20
Times. ""I'm not saying they're unique in that capacity. But they are unique=
ly=20
obstructionist.""
?????Davis said that, among other things, Reliant has opposed court and=20
federal orders that it sell power to the state and recently refused to=20
forgive a portion of the hundreds of millions of dollars it is owed by=20
California's utilities.
?????Reliant also informed Davis that it is asking higher prices in part=20
because it added a credit charge, essentially questioning the state's=20
credit-worthiness.
?????Last Thursday, the governor decided to go public--to ""name names,"" in=
=20
the words of his chief political strategist, Garry South.
?????""The reason these generators have gotten away with murder is because=
=20
people in California don't know who they are,"" South said. ""They aren't=20
household names. . . . People are not familiar with their names, their logo=
,=20
or what they do.""
?????Breaching confidentiality surrounding the state's power purchases, Dav=
is=20
announced at a press conference that the state paid $2,000 per megawatt-hou=
r=20
to avert blackouts last week, and named Reliant as the seller.
?????The price--actually $1,900 per megawatt-hour--was five times recent=20
market prices.
?????The governor continued his attack on ABC's Sunday morning news show,=
=20
""This Week."" He again cited the amount Reliant had charged but this time pu=
t=20
a partisan spin on it.
?????""That is obscene,"" Davis said of the price. ""No one can defend that. T=

=20
and Vice President Cheney, and they can't just sit back there and say, 'Hey=
,=20
it ain't our problem.' ""
?????Reliant is a major political player nationally, particularly in the=20
Republican Party, giving more than $250,000 to various national GOP=20
committees last year. Steve Letbetter, Reliant's chief executive, was one o=
f=20
President Bush's so-called ""pioneers""--donors who committed that they would=
=20
raise at least $100,000 for his presidential campaign.
?????Like most independent power generators, Reliant has become a more=20

=20
last year--including $10,000 to Davis last May--and spending $106,000 on=20
lobbying, plus $40,000 so far this year.
?????Reliant spokesman Wheatley said that despite the governor's invective,=

his company is committed to seeking solutions to California's problems and=

that it has ""operated legally and ethically.""
?????""Regardless of what happens,"" Wheatley said, ""we're going to make ever=

that have been made.""=20
?????In fact, Reliant executives wonder whether the state is playing fairly=

?????Reliant Vice President John Stout said he never expected the state to=

pay that amount. He said the company bid exceptionally high in the hopes th=
at=20
it would not have to run one of its so-called peaker plants, which the=20

Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to pay $41.2 million in overdue property taxes=

U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali on Wednesday turned down the utility's=

The judge told PG&E lawyers, ""Somebody is going to have to tell me why I ha=
ve=20
to hold California counties hostage for debts that you owe.""=20
He instructed to the utility to pay the taxes -- which were due on April 10=
=20
-- in full within five days. The judge said PG&E and the counties could=20
negotiate later about whether the utility must pay penalties, which include=
 a=20
10 percent delinquent penalty plus 1.5 percent per month in interest.=20
The taxes accrued between Jan. 1 and April 5, the day before PG&E filed its=
=20
petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection. Because the filing of=
=20
the petition suspended previous debts, PG&E needed court authorization to p=

them.=20
A group of 16 counties -- including Alameda, San Francisco, Santa Clara and=
=20
Sonoma counties in the Bay area -- opposed PG&E's plan to pay only counties=
=20
that waived the penalties.=20
San Francisco City Attorney Louise Renne said after the hearing, ""The rulin=

More blackouts but no ransom payments for energy gougers -- that's a deal=
=20
looking increasingly attractive to California lawmakers and consumer=20
advocates.=20
The idea, which has attracted the support of some key lawmakers and the=20
cautious interest of Gov. Gray Davis, is for the state to set a firm ceilin=
g=20
on what it will pay power producers for electricity this summer -- and not=
=20
one dime more.=20
The trade-off would be certain blackouts, possibly more than if the state=
=20
continues to pay any price electricity sellers demand.=20
Some advocates of the idea think that California could minimize the number =
of=20
blackout hours and gain a measure of control over the energy crisis by=20
scheduling service interruptions.=20
""We need to stop this game of electricity chicken,"" said Michael Shames,=20
director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network, which first proposed the=
=20
idea. ""We are likely to see blackouts this summer; we should use them to ou=
r=20
advantage rather than be victimized by them.""=20
The plan calls for creating a ""buyers' cartel"" of California, Oregon and=20
Washington. Essentially, the states would decide at what price they were=20
willing to buy power and refuse to purchase once it tops that level.=20
The state has spent $6 billion on energy purchases since January, and at on=
e=20
point during last week's power shortage was spending $1,900 per megawatt ho=
ur=20
-- more than 10 times what Davis has planned on for this summer. That kind =
of=20
spending cannot go on, Democratic Assemblyman Fred Keeley of Boulder Creek=
=20
said yesterday.=20
""The question is, can we sustain the level of spending we have and have the=

who introduced a resolution along with fellow Democratic Assemblyman Paul=

Koretz of West Hollywood that urged Davis to form a cartel.=20

Davis said last week that ""my bias would be to keep the lights on at any=20

""certainly a matter we've talked about and considered at some length. The=

next step will be to see how the governors of Oregon and Washington respond=
=20
to it.""=20
A spokesman for Gov. Gary Locke of Washington said the matter is being=20
considered. Calls to the office of Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber were not=20
returned.=20
The idea has appeal among some consumers who believe, as many state officia=
ls=20
do, that California is being gouged for electricity.=20
""I can see if our bills were $20 or $30 more, but this is ridiculous,"" said=
=20
Kimberly Chambers, an 18-year-old fashion design student from Oakland.=20
""Whatever it takes, I don't think we should have to pay for more.""=20

Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institu=

=20
believe.=20
""I think they (power companies) would call our bluff,"" and sell their=20

The maximum the state would pay would be set by a formula, based on such=20
things as the cost of natural gas. A reasonable profit for power producers=

LOOKING FOR SOME CONTROL
Alpert said everyone wants to avoid blackouts, but that seems unlikely.=20

The California Manufacturers and Technology Association, which commissioned=

San Francisco -- San Francisco International Airport officials angrily=20
accused a Texas energy firm yesterday of an 11th-hour attempt to price goug=
e=20
the airport in a deal for a 51-megawatt ""peaker"" plant needed to avoid summ=
er=20
blackouts.=20
Instead, airport officials said they will work with the city-owned Hetch=20
Hetchy Water and Power agency to fast-track development of its own gas-fire=
d=20
peaker plant, said airport spokesman Ron Wilson. The goal will be to build =
a=20
permanent 571-megawatt plant that could power 571,000 homes.=20
An irate Wilson said the airport broke off negotiations with El Paso Mercha=
nt=20
Energy Co. after the Houston firm allegedly jacked up the cost of the deal.=
=20
An original agreement to supply power to the airport was approved by the=20
airport commission March 20. The day before it was to be voted on, El Paso=
=20
indicated that it was going to need more money -- and the airport said the=
=20
numbers being discussed were untenable.=20
""They wanted to get into our pockets so deep that we're not even dealing wi=
th=20
them anymore,"" Wilson said. The terms of the rejected agreement were not=20
immediately available yesterday.=20
""DOLLAR SIGNS FLASHING""=20
""The dollar signs are flashing in their eyes and they don't care whether=20
you've got power or not as long as they can make their money,"" Wilson said.=
=20
An official of the Texas firm's parent company, El Paso Corp., expressed=20
surprise at the San Francisco airport's decision to break off negotiations=
=20
and denied any charges that the supplier tried to shake down the airport.=
=20
""As far as we're concerned, we're still negotiating on the project with the=
m=20
and we'd love to do it,"" said Norma Dunn, an El Paso senior vice president.=

Airport officials said yesterday that the airport now plans to begin=20
assembling 10 one-megawatt plants that could be running by June 1 to help=
=20
keep airport terminals cool when the summer power crunch arrives.=20
SEVERAL SCENARIOS
Because the California Energy Commission has already licensed the El Paso=
=20
peaker plant, SFO could quickly take over the project under several=20
scenarios, said Claudia Chandler, the CEC's assistant executive director.=
=20
The fastest way is for El Paso to voluntarily transfer the plant license to=
=20
SFO, which could have the peaker plant running by late July, she said.=20
If El Paso won't cooperate, SFO could seek its own license under a 21-day=
=20
approval process that Gov. Gray Davis ordered in February to speed=20
development of the temporary plants.=20
Given the 21-day approval, SFO could have the plant running by September. T=
o=20
speed approval, Chandler said, the airport would have to keep the location,=

size and type of plant similar to the El Paso proposal.=20
If there are substantial changes, SFO could seek a seven-day license=20
amendment.=20
""Even if SFO was unsuccessful in negotiating with El Paso to transfer the=

San Francisco -- Bay Area governments, strapped by rising energy costs,=20
received a bit of a boost yesterday when a federal bankruptcy judge ordered=
=20
the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to pay their outstanding property taxes, b=
ut=20
the overall energy outlook still appears bleak.=20
Rising energy bills in San Francisco, for example, forced a Board of=20

=20
aside for everything from hospital laundry service to heat at the jails.=20
A Bankruptcy Court judge in San Francisco ordered PG&E to pay $41 million i=
n=20
overdue property taxes the utility owes California counties.=20
The utility's taxes were due April 10. It's still unclear whether PG&E will=
=20
have to pay roughly $8 million in penalty fees to 49 counties.=20
""Money like that is welcome,"" said Napa County Treasurer-Tax Collector Marc=
ia=20
Humphrey, whose county is owed $262,364 in property taxes and another $26,0=
00=20
in penalties.=20
While yesterday's decision helps, Bay Area cities and counties are struggli=
ng=20
to balance higher energy costs with the other demands on their budgets.=20
For example, Alameda County spent $1.4 million on natural gas during the la=
st=20
fiscal year and expects to spend $2.3 million during the current fiscal yea=
r,=20
which ends June 30. Next year, the natural gas budget will jump to $2.7=20
million, said Matthew Muniz, energy program manager for Alameda County.=20
Alameda County had budgeted $6.8 million for electricity costs, Muniz said,=
=20
but that may balloon to $12.3 million in the worst case scenario. The=20
additional money has been set aside in a contingency fund so services=20
shouldn't be affected.=20
Santa Clara County faces a similar situation.=20
""The (power) budget is going to be bigger this year, that's for sure. But h=
ow=20
much bigger, we don't know yet,"" said Kevin Carruth, Santa Clara County's=
=20
director of the General Services Agency.=20
In San Francisco, operations supported by the general fund -- among them=20
recreation centers, the hospital and health clinics, police stations,=20
firehouses, the animal shelter and the jails -- originally were allocated=
=20
$10. 5 million for energy costs. Now the bills are projected to jump to=20
nearly $17 million -- a 61 percent increase.=20
Some departments plan to absorb all or part of the costs; others needed a=
=20
special handout, totaling $4 million, which the Board of Supervisors Financ=
e=20
Committee approved yesterday. Operations that don't rely on the general fun=
d,=20
such as Muni and the airport, are expected to overspend their power budgets=
=20
by another $5 million, bringing the citywide energy deficit to $11 million.=
=20
""It's a strain on the budget, but it's not a budget buster,"" said City=20
Controller Ed Harrington.=20
As power costs have jumped, the city has fattened its coffers with an extra=

=20
Hetch Hetchy power agency, which generates and sells electricity, will be=

Meanwhile, government leaders are looking for creative ways to combat the=

San Francisco Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano yesterday presente=
d=20
an ambitious proposal to install a network of energy-producing panels on=20
rooftops in San Francisco's sunny neighborhoods. Ammiano predicted that in=

seven to 10 years the project could produce up to 50 megawatts of=20

Nuclear, fossil fuels at heart of Bush plan=20

Washington -- The Bush administration, warning that the nation faces its mo=
st=20
serious energy crisis since the 1973 oil embargo, last night released=20
highlights of a long-awaited national energy plan that relies on increasing=
=20
supplies of energy.=20
As expected, the plan proposes to increase production of fossil fuels and=
=20
nuclear power, in many cases by easing regulatory barriers, while sweetenin=
g=20
the deal with $6.3 billion in new tax credits for ""green energy"" fuels such=
=20
as solar and biomass.=20
While declaring that years of ""neglect"" have created the problem, the=20
administration's report on the plan insists that technology, not austerity,=
=20
offers a way out.=20
""Our prosperity and way of life are sustained by energy use,"" the report=20
says.=20
Speaking briefly to reporters, President Bush called the plan ""a very=20
optimistic look at America,"" but one that is ""tough, in that it lays out th=
e=20
problems.""=20
The 163-page plan cites California's blackouts in its second paragraph,=20
saying they ""demonstrate the problem of neglecting energy supply."" But as t=
o=20
immediate remedies, the plan says, ""unfortunately, there are no short-term=
=20
solutions to long-term neglect.""=20
""We're going to solve this problem,"" Bush said early yesterday before the=
=20
report's release. ""This isn't just a report that's going to gather dust.""=
=20
Reacting to charges that he is offering no immediate relief on gasoline=20
prices and is captive to the energy industry, Bush also promised that his=
=20
administration would ""make sure that nobody in American gets illegally=20
overcharged"" for gasoline and that federal electricity regulators would=20
monitor prices ""to make sure they are fair and reasonable.""=20
Bush also said he has worked with California officials to expedite power=20
plant permitting and is ""deeply concerned"" about the state.=20
""The quicker supply gets on, the easier it's going to be for the consumers =
in=20
the state of California,"" Bush said.=20
White House officials said Bush will issue two executive orders next week=
=20
that would direct federal agencies to speed permitting of energy facilities=
=20
and require studies of the energy impact of regulatory actions.=20
As the administration has said in interviews and statements the past month,=
=20
the report focuses on increasing supplies of traditional fossil fuels and=
=20
nuclear power, with a heavy stress on updating the nation's electricity gri=
d=20
and other energy infrastructure.=20
A senior administration described the grid as a relic of the 1950s that=20
balkanizes the country into isolated power islands, preventing transmission=
=20
from areas of ample supply to areas of shortages.=20
In an attempt to mitigate rising gasoline prices, the report also orders an=
=20
Environmental Protection Agency review of ""boutique"" gasoline formulas that=
=20
various states require to control air pollution. The aim is to standardize=
=20
fuel blends so that regions are less dependent on single refineries.=20
In a pre-emptive strike, Democrats attacked the plan as ineffective hours=
=20
before the highlights were released.=20
""The president seems almost totally indifferent"" to California's blackouts,=
=20
said House minority leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.=20
The report calls for easing regulations that inhibit new electricity=20
transmission lines and gas pipelines, including calling for federal=20
condemnation of private property to build power lines.=20
It stresses increased use of coal as the nation's ""most abundant fuel sourc=
e""=20
and recommends revisiting nuclear power, encouraging expansion of existing=
=20
plants and easier licensing for new nuclear technologies.=20
DRILLING ON PUBLIC LANDS
And it calls for a thorough review of all public lands to open areas for=20
potential oil and gas exploration, including a recommendation that 8 percen=
t=20
of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge be opened to oil and gas exploration=
.=20
Administration officials said there are no plans to challenge the current=
=20
moratoriums on new oil leasing off the coasts of California or Florida.=20
But the policy also makes a pitch for renewable fuels and conservation. The=
=20
report calls for applying new technologies to conservation, including a $4=
=20
billion tax credit for hybrid automobiles that run on both gasoline and=20
electricity, including fuel cells.=20

Bush's national energy bluepring won't help California=20

Mercury News Washington Bureau=20


WASHINGTON -- President Bush will unveil a national energy plan today that=
=20
offers little help for California this summer but tries to shield the rest =
of=20
the nation from the same debilitating blackouts in the future with more oil=
=20
and natural-gas drilling and greater use of coal and nuclear power.=20
In previewing the plan Wednesday, Bush and White House officials emphasized=
=20
that conservation and improving energy efficiency through high technology a=
re=20
significant parts in meeting the nation's growing energy needs and reducing=
=20
dependence on foreign oil. Of the plan's 105 proposals -- most already made=
=20
public -- 42 deal with conservation, development of alternative fuels and=
=20
environmental protection.=20
A senior administration official said Wednesday that the only item in the=
=20
plan that could help California this summer is a planned presidential order=
=20
to have federal agencies expedite permit approvals for new power plants=20
nationwide. But Bush already ordered those quicker reviews for California=
=20
earlier this year. The other specific California proposal would direct the=
=20
secretary of energy to look into helping the state improve the current=20
transmission bottleneck between Northern and Southern California.=20
``Unfortunately, there are no short-term solutions to long-term neglect,''=
=20
the Bush plan says of California's crisis.=20
More broadly, the White House believes the proposals to increase supply and=
=20
improve electricity and natural-gas distribution are the keys to helping=20
California and the rest of the country deal with energy problems. The=20
163-page proposal says the United States is facing ``the most serious energ=
y=20
shortage since the oil embargoes of the 1970s.''=20
Bush on Wednesday directed two federal regulatory agencies to monitor=20
electricity prices in the state and elsewhere and ``make sure that nobody i=
n=20
America gets illegally charged.''=20
But the state's problem is largely its own to solve, Bush administration=20
officials have repeatedly said.=20
California Gov. Gray Davis has been pleading with federal regulators to=20
temporarily cap the price of wholesale electricity throughout the West to=
=20
give the state time to get new power plants on line. But Bush on Wednesday=
=20
reiterated his opposition to those controls.=20
That angered Davis and other California Democrats.=20
``Without just and reasonable prices for power, the crisis here in Californ=
ia=20
and the West inevitably will spill over and damage the already-sluggish=20
national economy,'' Davis said. ``Mr. President, runaway energy prices are=
=20
not just a California problem. With all due respect, I once again urge you =
to=20
stand up to your friends in the energy business and exercise the federal=20
government's responsibility to ensure energy prices are just and=20
reasonable.''=20
Long-term proposals=20
Instead of price controls for California or elsewhere, the White House is=
=20
focusing on long-term energy proposals that may not even get passed by=20
Congress, let alone be producing results, by the height of California's=20
summer.=20
For example, drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which Bu=
sh=20
is asking Congress to allow, is not expected to produce any oil for at leas=
t=20
five to 10 years. The supply is estimated at 6 billion barrels, enough to=
=20
satisfy total U.S. demand for only nine months.=20
Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have said several times since taking=20
office that the administration believes that the main way to solve the=20
problem is to increase the nation's energy supplies.=20
That stance, backed by most Republicans and the energy industry that Bush a=
nd=20
Cheney both once worked for, puts the administration at odds with most=20
Democrats and the environmental movement. The plan's release officially=20
ignites one of the largest political battles in years.=20
``It provides over 100 proposals to diversify and increase the supply of=20
energy, innovative proposals to encourage conservation and ways to make sur=
e=20
that we get energy from producer to consumer,'' Bush said Wednesday after=
=20
receiving the plan from the high-level administration task force headed by=
=20
Cheney that drafted it over the past three months.=20
But Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club, said the=20
administration's conservation proposals don't change the fact that the Whit=
e=20
House plan overall is bad for the environment and the nation.=20
``There's a Texas saying that the president apparently is very fond of, whi=
ch=20
goes, `You can put your boots in the oven, but it doesn't make them=20
biscuits,'?'' Pope said. ``When they start claiming this plan is about clea=
n=20
energy, about progressive technology, about energy efficiency, they're=20
putting their boots in the oven. I'd rather bake biscuits.''=20
Highlights of plans=20
Among the highlights released by the White House last night are:=20
?Require that all major federal regulatory actions take into account the=20
impact on energy supplies, distribution and use, including decisions made=
=20
about federal lands.=20
?Encourage the expansion of nuclear-power plants, and study whether=20
reprocessed nuclear waste can be used to generate power. The technology,=20
abandoned in the United States 30 years ago but used elsewhere, produces=20
weapons-grade plutonium that can lead to national security risks.=20
?Spend $3 billion over 10 years on programs to assist low-income people wit=
h=20
heating and electric bills as well as to prepare their homes for cold=20
weather.=20
?Spend an additional $2 billion over 10 years on research into burning coal=
=20
more cleanly.=20
?Spend $4 billion over 10 years on tax credits for consumers who purchase=
=20
hybrid electric-gasoline vehicles or vehicles powered by new hydrogen fuel=
=20
cells.=20
``It's tough in that it lays out the problems,'' Bush continued. ``It's a=
=20
direct assessment of neglect, but this great nation of ours, because of our=
=20
technology, our attitude, our adherence to free enterprise, our willingness=
=20
to conserve, we're going to solve this problem.''=20
The vast majority of the proposals -- 85 -- can be acted on by Bush and=20
federal agencies, and 20 require congressional approval.=20
While serving as the poster child for a potential national energy crisis,=
=20
California gets little assistance in the Bush plan as it faces a summer of=
=20
soaring prices and predictions of extensive rolling blackouts. Bush noted t=
he=20
administration had worked with Davis to expedite federal review of state=20
power plant proposals.=20
``So the quicker supply gets on, the easier it's going to be for the=20
consumers of the state of California. We're deeply concerned about the stat=
e=20

Cogeneration will get presidential spotlight=20

WASHINGTON -- President Bush and environmental groups agree on at least one=
=20
part of his energy plan. Both want to promote a kind of utility plant that=
=20
produces both electricity and heat or air conditioning and operates twice a=
s=20
efficiently as existing power plants.=20
Bush will spotlight the process, called combined heating and power, or=20
cogeneration, today in St. Paul, Minn., when he unveils his energy policy a=
t=20
the city's downtown heating-and-cooling plant, which soon will be making=20
electricity, too.=20
Two-thirds of the potential energy in the coal, oil or natural gas burned i=
n=20
conventional electric power plants escapes as waste heat or pollution. In a=
=20
cogeneration plant, the waste heat is used to warm buildings or run air=20
conditioners.=20
``We use two fires when we could use one,'' said Tom Casten, president of=
=20
Private Power LLC, a Chicago-area combined heat company, and the chair of t=
he=20
International Cogeneration Alliance, based in Brussels, Belgium.=20
U.S. cogeneration has been growing in recent years, but it isn't as popular=
=20
as it is in Europe, Casten said. The United States gets 7 to 9 percent of i=
ts=20
power from cogeneration plants, he said. Mainly, heavy industries, college=
=20
campuses and downtown sections of older cities such as New York and=20
Philadelphia use it.=20
Denmark gets 59 percent of its electricity from cogeneration; the Netherlan=
ds=20
gets 42 percent. Finland hasn't built a new central power plant in 20 years=
=20
and China in the past decade hooked up a system to heat 55 million families=
=20
through cogeneration plants, Casten said.=20
``There's an incredible amount we can do which we're not doing,'' Casten=20
said. ``If we operated at the efficiency of the Netherlands or Finland we'd=
=20
save $77 billion a year.''=20
To move in that direction, the Bush administration's new energy policy will=
=20
include two provisions. One would speed up depreciation under the tax code=
=20
for cogeneration equipment. The other would rewrite environmental regulatio=
ns=20
in ways that would make cogeneration easier.=20
The Bush plan also will try to improve relations between cogeneration=20
companies and conventional power companies. They are split over two issues:=
=20
how conventional utility companies pay for electrical power from cogenerato=
rs=20
and how they get it.=20
Some environmental groups are grudgingly on board. ``They're making all the=

On Tuesday, the California Public Utilities Commission bowed to the reality=

of the electricity shortage. People will have to pay more. Industry will pa=

a lot more. One beneficial side effect should be that they use less power.=
=20
Until now, consumers have been buffered from high electricity prices.=20
Starting June 1, that's over, except for residents who are especially=20
thrifty.=20
The PUC imposed an overall rate increase of 3 cents per kilowatt hour in=20
March, but it did not decide until Tuesday how to apportion the pain among=

residents, farmers, businesses and industry.=20
The allocation of pain left no one happy. The only thing certain in cases=

The PUC ``caves in to industry lobbying,'' said the consumer group TURN. Th=

Discounting the hyperbole, industry has the more compelling grievance, even=
=20
though industrial rates have declined relative to residential rates over th=
e=20
past two decades, from a time when they were almost the same.=20
Electricity costs less per unit to deliver to industries than to residences=
.=20
In the PUC's rate hike, industry should have been asked to pay only the 3=
=20
cents a kilowatt hour instead of roughly 3.5 cents. That still would have=
=20
given it a much larger percentage increase than residences.=20
Residents will hardly welcome higher bills. They will rightly suspect that=
=20
generators of electricity are taking advantage of the shortage to squeeze=
=20
consumers. That is a claim to be pursued in Sacramento, Washington and the=
=20
courts.=20
The PUC had no choice but to raise rates, given what the state has been=20
paying to buy electricity. And despite what hysterical protesters at the PU=
C=20
meetings have said, residents can keep their bills manageable with a litle=
=20
sacrifice.=20
Electricity usage that falls below 130 percent of the so-called baseline=20
level is exempt from the rate increase. While 130 percent of baseline is le=
ss=20
electricity than many households need, those who use up to 200 percent of=
=20
baseline, a more achievable goal, will see their bills rise only 7 percent,=
=20
from $76 to $81 for average households in the Bay Area.=20
The PUC correctly structured the rate schedule to be punitive toward those=
=20
households that use the most electricity. For those who use 300 percent of=
=20
baseline or more, the bills rise 37 percent.=20
If there is any consolation here, it is this: California consistently ranks=
=20
among the states using the least amount of electricity per capita. While=20
higher rates will harm some businesses and residents, the state economy as =
a=20
whole is not dependent on an abundance of cheap power.=20
The rate hike will cost users of electricity $5.7 billion, which the state'=

Calif. Enters Wholesale Business



By JENNIFER COLEMAN
Associated Press Writer




SACRAMENTO (AP) _ Gov. Gray Davis signed a bill Wednesday
creating a state agency that will be able to borrow up to $5
billion to build, buy, lease or operate power plants.


California will no longer be held captive by energy suppliers
charging high prices for power, Davis pledged, as he officially put
the state into the electricity wholesale business.


Plants financed by the California Consumer Power and
Conservation Financing Authority will provide cost-based
electricity to California consumers, Davis said, which will help
stabilize the state's volatile energy market.


The power authority is modeled after one in New York, which has
10 power plants, 1,400 miles of transmission lines and produces
about 25 percent of the state's power. Nebraska also has a power
authority, which created a market in which residents pay 22 percent
less than the national average.


An increase in power plants down for repairs this year ``is
strong evidence that people are manipulating the market by
withholding power to drive up prices,'' Davis said.


``The only way we can fight back against this type of price
gouging and manipulation is to build more plants,'' he said.


Having a public power authority will ``supplement not supplant''
private energy sources, Davis said.


``In a deregulated world, the only way you can guarantee
reliable affordable power is to build it yourself if private
companies won't do it,'' he said.


Few Republicans in the Legislature supported the bill, saying
the state shouldn't get further into the power business. They also
warned that it could discourage private companies from building
plants.


The bill was created by Senate Leader John Burton and sponsored
by state treasurer Philip Angelides. Angelides conceded that it
won't save California from blackouts this summer but will help
stabilize the energy markets as more generators are built.


Angelides added that the bill is the ``beginning of the end for
deregulation ... which has proven to be a disaster.''


He repeatedly blamed the crisis on out-of-state power
generators: ``There is a tremendous drain on California because of
generators' prices. And that drain is heading straight to the heart
of Texas.''


Other key lawmakers urged Davis Wednesday to join with the
governors of Washington and Oregon to set a limit on the price the
states would pay for power this summer, creating a ``buyers'
cartel.''


The states would refuse to pay more than a predetermined price
that would give electricity generators a ``reasonable'' profit
under a resolution sponsored by nine Assembly Democrats.


If generators refused to lower their prices, that would mean
almost certain blackouts in California this summer, said
Assemblyman Paul Koretz, the measure's author.


But those will happen anyway, by all accounts, and the price cap
would let the state better predict and manage the outages, he said.


The resolution proposes that caps be installed for two years,
until enough power plants can be built to allow the market to
function naturally.


The state has been buying power for the customers of three major
utilities since mid-January. The utilities' credit was cut off
after they amassed debts of more than $14 billion dollars due to
high wholesale electricity prices that they were unable to pass on
to customers.

GOP Promises Energy Package Push



By H. JOSEF HEBERT
Associated Press Writer




WASHINGTON (AP) _ Awaiting an energy blueprint from the White
House, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott promised to move quickly
on legislation, hoping Congress can complete action before the end
of summer.


But Lott said Wednesday that some of President Bush's expected
recommendations, such as expanded drilling on federal land and
taking private land for power lines, ``will be hotly debated'' on
Capitol Hill.


Democrats launched a pre-emptive strike Wednesday, saying the
Bush energy package will do little to address soaring gasoline
prices, the West Coast power crisis and the need to get Americans
to use less energy.


``The president seems almost totally indifferent'' to soaring
electricity problems and blackouts in the West, said House Minority
Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.


White House press secretary Ari Fleischer insisted that the
president's energy task force, while focusing on long-term energy
problems, also will have measures that ``will help in the short
term.''


The ``comprehensive approach'' to be outlined by the president's
105 specific energy proposals ``will help consumers'' this summer,
said Fleischer, who didn't provide details.


Other government sources said the task force recommendations
will direct Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Christie
Whitman to look into ways to give refiners more leeway in blending
gasoline to spur supply and ease distribution.


The task force will ask the EPA to try to get states to abandon
requirements for ``boutique'' gasoline blends as part of their air
pollution control strategies.


The industry has blamed the requirement for many different
blends for some of the refinery and distribution problems, a claim
disputed by environmentalists.


The task force also will call for increased funding of the
federal programs to help low-income families pay for cooling and
heating costs, said the sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.


Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress agree those funds
should be beefed up.


Lott, R-Miss., speaking to reporters, said he hoped to bring an
energy bill to the Senate floor next month and have it to the
president by July 4 ``or certainly this summer.''


As for Democratic criticism that the GOP approach tilts too
heavily toward production, Lott said, ``I don't believe we can
conserve ourselves into (meeting) the energy needs we'll have in
the future.''


``The president has no program for the short term, telling
people that they're on their own. And the only long-term solution
is to waive environmental protections,'' Gephardt countered at a
news conference.


Among the recommendations that will be made by the president's
energy task force is a call for more transmission lines and power
plants to address future electricity needs and changes in air
pollution rules to improve the production and distribution of
gasoline, according to government sources.


Against strong opposition from environmentalists, the task force
also will call for lifting the ban on oil drilling in the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. Specifically, Bush will call
for opening 8 percent of the pristine territory to oil drilling,
Fleischer said Wednesday.


But none of these proposals will provide much help this summer,
officials acknowledge.


Meanwhile industry experts predicted more severe power problems
in California, including frequent rolling blackouts; possible power
disruptions in the Northeast; and tight electricity supplies in the
Pacific Northwest because of the region's severe drought.


The North American Electric Reliability Council, an
industry-sponsored watchdog organization, said in a report Tuesday
that California's power problems this summer are likely to be worse
than even state officials have predicted, with 260 hours of rolling
blackouts _ an average of 20 hours a week _ likely because of a
power shortfall that could be as much as 5,000 megawatts during
peak demand periods.


A megawatt is enough power to serve 1,000 homes.


While most of the country will have enough electricity, the
council's report also warned of potential problems in the
Northeast, with possible power disruptions if there is a persistent
heat wave, and in the Pacific Northwest as well as possibly in
Texas. The New York City area could have blackouts if there are
transmission problems on lines into the region, the report said.


While Texas has plenty of electricity, it ``should be closely
watched'' because the state is shifting into a retail competitive
market in June and consolidating some grid management activities,
David Cook, the reliability council's general counsel, said.


``There is no magic bullet, no single thing to be done that will
solve the challenges we face'' in trying to assure electricity
reliability, Cook said in testimony before the Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee.


In the Pacific Northwest, there is expected to be enough power
to meet summer demand despite low hydroelectric generation as a
result of a severe drought. But, the report said, if the region's
drought continues, there could be rolling blackouts next winter.






Covanta Energy to Provide California With 500 Megawatts of New Power



FAIRFIELD, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 16, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -



California Energy Commission Grants Approval to Three Mountain


Power Facility


Covanta Energy Corporation (NYSE: COV) announced that the
California Energy Commission (CEC) today unanimously approved the
Company's ""Application for Certification"" for its proposed
500-megawatt Three Mountain Power project. The decision, which was
announced at a CEC business meeting in Sacramento, California, grants
Covanta a license to construct and operate the natural gas-fired,
combined cycle facility to be located in Burney, approximately 45
miles northeast of Redding, California. Project construction is
expected to begin in the fall of 2001, with commercial operations
expected to commence in late 2003 or early 2004.


""Three Mountain Power will be a vital addition to California's
energy supply, adding 500 megawatts of environmentally friendly,
dependable power to the grid,"" said Scott Mackin, President and Chief
Executive Officer of Covanta Energy. ""Given the urgent need for power,
we're pleased that CEC has approved this project. With its
state-of-the-art technology, Three Mountain Power will be among the
cleanest and most efficient power plants of its kind in the nation, if
not the world.""


The Three Mountain Power project will also bring significant
economic benefits to the Burney region. An average of 200 construction
workers will build the project over two years, with an estimated
construction payroll of $25 million. Three Mountain Power will also
create between 20 and 25 new permanent jobs, with an annual payroll of
over $1 million. To allow local residents to train and potentially
compete for these jobs, Three Mountain Power is sponsoring Lassen
Community College's power plant operator training class in the
community. Once operational, the facility is expected to pay $2.5
million annually in property taxes.

electricity. Even so, enough energy would be available to meet the state's=

Indeed, according to Boulder, Colo.-based RDI's NEWGen database, more than=

Worm in the Big Apple
But those responsible for regulating the state's power supplies point to a=
=20
dilemma facing New York City.=20

In testimony before a state oversight panel in March, Public Utility=20
Commission Chair Maureen O. Helmer said at least 80% of New York City's=20
projected peak load must be met by generation located within the city. She=
=20
said the New York Independent System Operator (ISO) projected peak load for=
=20
the city of 10,535 MW, meaning roughly 8,428 MW would have to be generated =
in=20
the city, due to its import constraints.=20

But the same ISO report found only 8,031 MW of in-city generating capacity =
as=20
of Feb. 15. If correct, that adds up to a 397-MW shortfall, under normal=20
weather conditions. Under extreme weather conditions, New York City's peak=
=20
load could reach 11,125 MW, the ISO said. That would raise the correspondin=
g=20
in-city capacity requirement to 8,900 MW.=20

""Thus,"" Helmer said, ""the in-city generating deficiency would increase to 8=
69=20
MW rather than 397 MW."" Given the transmission constraints and the=20
possibility of much hotter than normal weather, ""397 MW must be viewed as a=
=20
floor, not a ceiling,"" she said.=20

Bottom line: Approve new capacity and install it quickly. The New York Powe=
r=20
Authority plans to add 450 MW of capacity within New York City before the=
=20
start of the summer peak demand season. Helmer said this amount would meet=
=20
minimum requirements and would help avoid calling on older, dirtier=20
generating plants.=20

Tougher rules
Policy makers in Massachusetts and Connecticut are waging an environmental=
=20
war of their own by imposing highly restrictive rules.=20

The Connecticut rules=01*described by one source as the ""toughest air emiss=

utive=20
order from Gov. John G. Rowland to reduce SO2 emissions by over 40,000 tons=

year (a 50% reduction) and NOx emissions by nearly 3,500 tons a year (a=20
20%-30% reduction) from 61 large emission units statewide, including power=

plants.=20

In April, Massachusetts imposed new rules of its own, targeting power plant=

emissions of NOx, SO2, mercury and=01*for the first time=01*carbon dioxide,=
 the=20

The Massachusetts rules are aimed squarely at six power plants (the so-call=

about half what federal law allows. By 2006, the plants would have to cut S=
O2=20
emissions by 53%-74%. Carbon dioxide emissions would be reduced by 10%, and=

airborne mercury emissions would also fall, by an amount to be set next yea=

As an alternative, state officials gave power plant owners until 2008 to=20

""We would utilize the rules under the second strategy and re-permit the=20

Another source at a generating company in the area, who asked to remain=20

strategy among states.=20

""After 10 years of the states and the feds saying there's a place for=20

Alex Farrell, research engineer in the Department of Engineering and Public=

let power companies ""average"" emissions across a region's entire fleet of=

A power plant operator might invest $100 million on scrubber technology for=

Using a regional averaging and emission trading approach, overachieving at =

When Athens was first proposed, three-quarters of the state's fossil-fired=

They settled on a one-story, 1,200-square-foot home on 10 acres of wooded=
=20
hillside in the Homestead Ranches subdivision. Ms. Nash says she made clear=
=20
to her real-estate agent that she didn't want to be near drilling but adds=
=20
that she didn't know about the separate ownership of mineral rights, and it=
=20
never was discussed.=20
She soon found out. While Ms. Nash was unpacking, a neighbor dropped by to=

say hello. ""You know you're in the window?"" Ms. Nash remembers the neighbor=

Ms. Nash.=20
The couple considered trying to sue the real-estate agent but decided the=
=20
cost would be too high. However, when negotiations with Huber over where to=
=20
drill broke down, they joined other surface-rights owners in a suit against=
=20
Huber and a unit of BP. The suit asks a state court for a judgment to clari=

Huber won't discuss this well site, citing the litigation, but its project=

engineer for the area, Scott Zimmerman, says the company has come to terms=

with other surface owners. ""Most of them realize there is a mineral estate,=
=20

he adds, ""We have the rights to develop the minerals.""=20
Indeed, Colorado law allows operators to drill over property owners'=20
objections after posting a bond of as little as $5,000 per well against=20
possible surface damage. State regulators say about a third of the drilling=
=20
permits they grant each year are on sites where the surface rights and=20

Drillers can generally use an amount of land that is considered ""reasonable=

Drilling issues are a different matter. Last month, the state enacted a law=

WASHINGTON, May 16 -- President Bush's long-awaited energy plan proposes=20
loosening regulations on oil and gas exploration, conservation-minded effor=
ts=20
like a review of gas mileage standards and a $4 billion tax credit for a ne=
w=20
generation of highly fuel efficient cars, and urges a reconsideration of a=
=20
quarter-century ban on the reprocessing of nuclear fuel.=20
With a declaration that the energy problems threaten the nation's economy a=
nd=20
security, the Bush plan also orders a sweeping review of public lands to=20
determine whether more energy resources can be extracted.=20
''America in the year 2001 faces the most serious energy shortage since the=
=20
oil embargoes of the 1970's,'' the administration's energy report states.=
=20
Without action, it continues, projected energy shortfalls in coming years=
=20
''will inevitably undermine our economy, our standard of living and our=20
national security.'' [Excerpts, Page A21.]=20
The proposals are among 105 initiatives outlined in the administration's=20
energy report, said a senior government official who briefed reporters on i=
ts=20
contents tonight. The White House released an eight-page overview of the=20
document, which will be distributed in full on Thursday.=20
The official said Mr. Bush would also issue two executive orders later this=
=20
week directing all federal agencies to consider the effects of all new=20
regulations on energy production and to expedite permits for all energy=20
projects ''while remaining mindful of protecting the environment.''=20
The overview released tonight states that federal regulation of the nation'=
s=20
energy producers has unduly inhibited production and increased prices.=20
''Regulation is needed in such a complex field, but it has become overly=20
burdensome,'' the report says. ''Regulatory hurdles, delays in issuing=20
permits and economic uncertainty are limiting investment in new facilities,=
=20
making our energy markets more vulnerable to transmission bottlenecks, pric=
e=20
spikes and supply disruptions.''=20
Mr. Bush will also order Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton, an outspoken=20
proponent of seeking new sources of energy on federal lands, to ''look at a=
ny=20
impediments'' that discourage exploration for oil and gas.=20
The report repeats Mr. Bush's commitment to explore in the Arctic National=
=20
Wildlife Refuge -- a proposal that seems unlikely to survive in Congress --=
=20
and also urges a review that will include other places in Alaska, the Rocky=
=20
Mountains and along the Gulf Coast.=20
The report also urges the revision or reinterpretation of a major clause of=
=20
the Clean Air Act that requires long government review of any modifications=
=20
of power plants that affect their emissions.=20
The senior government official, who was deeply involved in the development =
of=20
the plan, argued tonight that the ''new source reviews'' by the Environment=
al=20
Protection Agency are a ''time-consuming process'' that often ''discourage=
=20
fuel efficiency.''=20
The Justice Department will also be ordered to review several=20
multi-million-dollar lawsuits brought by the Clinton administration against=
=20
utilities accused of ignoring the law.=20
One official of an environmental group said the report was about what he ha=
d=20
expected, and he predicted that conservation organizations would be highly=
=20
critical of it.=20
''This has just a lot of opportunity for mischief from the energy producers=
=20
and no real solid commitments for the green components,'' the official, Dav=
id=20
G. Hawkins, senior lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said.=
=20
Mr. Hawkins said he was ''astounded'' that the policy would recommend a=20
review of legal actions now under way on utility emissions, calling it=20
''political interference with law enforcement.''=20
Mr. Bush is to announce his plan on Thursday morning at an innovative energ=
y=20
plant in St. Paul. But even before he begins his campaign for a national=20
energy policy, he has touched off a heated political argument between=20
Democrats and Republicans over how to balance environmental concerns agains=
t=20
growing energy needs, and whether to impose temporary price caps in places=
=20
like California, where a deregulation program and soaring demand has sent=
=20
prices rocketing.=20
Democrats have urged the use of such controls, while Mr. Bush will argue=20
''vociferously'' on Thursday, one aide said, that the controls would only=
=20
discourage the production of more electricity.=20
Mr. Bush's report adopts a tone that is by turns admonishing and encouragin=
g.=20
''The complacency of the past decade must now give way to swift, but=20
well-considered, action,'' it says in its introduction, echoing themes that=
=20
Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, who headed the task force, have=20
sounded in recent weeks.=20
''Present trends are not encouraging, but they are not immutable,'' the=20
report says.=20
Then, in a clear effort to separate Mr. Bush's approach from President Jimm=
y=20
Carter's politically disastrous calls for household austerity during the=20
energy crises of the late 1970's, it adds: ''Our country has met many great=
=20
tests. Some have imposed extreme hardship and sacrifice. Others have demand=
ed=20
only resolve, ingenuity and clarity of purpose. Such is the case with energ=
y=20
today.''=20
The decision to offer a relatively hefty tax credit for ''hybrid'' cars,=20
which use a combination of gasoline and battery power, is bound to help bot=
h=20
Detroit and two Japanese automakers -- Honda and Toyota -- which are alread=
y=20
marketing such vehicles in the United States.=20
They will be less enthusiastic, however, about orders by Mr. Bush for the=
=20
government to review the federal standards for automotive fuel efficiency,=
=20
though the report makes no commitment that those standards will be raised.=
=20
The plan also calls for a new evaluation of nuclear reprocessing, a=20
technology that takes advantage of the fact that as reactors consume uraniu=
m,=20
they also produce plutonium. If the plutonium is chemically scavenged from=
=20
the fuel, it can be used to run reactors.=20
But the technology has drawbacks. The work is dirty, with the threat of=20
radioactive releases, and it is expensive.=20
For the last decade at least, it has been far cheaper to fuel reactors with=
=20
new uranium than to recover plutonium. And while uranium fuel used in power=
=20
reactors cannot be used to make a bomb, plutonium can, raising the threat o=
f=20
world commerce in a material that could be diverted by countries -- or=20
terrorist groups -- that want a bomb.=20
Britain, France and Japan currently reprocess fuel, although the British ar=
e=20
considering ending the practice because it is so expensive.=20
But reprocessing can reduce the volume of plutonium requiring disposal, whi=
ch=20
is important because plutonium is so long-lived and difficult to store=20
safely.=20
Some opponents of the technology said today that they believed it had been=
=20
included in the Bush plan as a sop to Nevada, where the Energy Department i=
s=20
trying to build a waste repository. But reprocessing would not eliminate th=
e=20
need for such a repository.=20
The plan also calls for cooperation with Canada on building a pipeline that=
=20
could bring more natural gas into the United States.=20
The report mixes several existing initiatives with new ones, particularly i=
n=20
the area of conservation. For example, of $10 billion in proposed tax credi=
ts=20
over the next 10 years, $5 billion in credits are already in the budget or=
=20
the result of extending existing ones.=20
Other programs get modest increases. The administration recommends $300=20
million in new money for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program and=
=20
calls for funneling some oil and gas royalty payments, which companies pay=
=20
the federal government for extracting resources on public land, to the=20
program for the poor.=20
Similarly, in an effort directed toward environmentalists, it would commit=
=20
royalties from any energy extracted in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve=
=20
for land conservation.=20
There are no credits or other tax breaks for oil or gas producers, or=20
electric utilities -- a reflection of the sensitivity of the White House to=
=20
criticism that Mr. Cheney and other top officials spent their private-secto=
r=20
years in the energy industry. But the tone of deregulation, reassessment of=
=20
the merits of the Clean Air Act and the emphasis on opening of federal land=
s=20
to more energy production -- everything from wind power to oil and gas=20
drilling -- provides those industries with effective subsidies totaling in=
=20
the billions of dollars.=20
Much of the report simply urges companies to build, build and build some=20
more, including 38,000 miles of new gas pipelines, 255,000 miles of=20
distribution pipelines and a new power plant every few days for the next 20=
=20
years. But for every such proposal, Mr. Bush's team carefully inserted=20
proposals for expanding the use of renewable fuels, from geo-thermal energy=
=20
sources to the methane produced in landfills.=20
The nuclear power industry gets one major concession: a tax break that woul=
d=20
eliminate the double taxation of money put aside for decommissioning plants=
.=20
Those taxes have been a deterrent to buying and selling nuclear plants. It=
=20
commits $2 billion over 10 years to a clean-coal technology program in the=
=20
Department of Energy.=20
It urges the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to speed the licensing of=
=20
hydroelectric power plants, and seeks ''market-based incentives'' to reduce=
=20
pollutants that cause global climate change.=20
But this winter Mr. Bush rejected any American participation in the Kyoto=

Power: She cites evidence that plants were shut down to create ""artificial=

shortages."" An industry spokesman calls the accusation ""idiocy.""=20

By RICH CONNELL and ROBERT LOPEZ, Times Staff Writers=20

?????State investigators have uncovered evidence that a ""cartel"" of power=
=20
companies shut down plants for unnecessary maintenance to ratchet up prices=
,=20
the head of the California Public Utilities Commission asserted Thursday.
?????PUC President Loretta Lynch said her agency, working with the state=20
attorney general's office, is probing patterns of plant outages that have=
=20
created ""artificial shortages,"" particularly when the state has issued=20
emergency alerts because of seriously low levels of electricity.
?????""There are instances where plants could have produced, and they chose=
=20
not to,"" Lynch said in an interview at The Times.
?????""And it is clear that there are instances that plants, when called to=
=20
produce, chose not to produce,"" even when they were obligated to do so unde=
r=20
special contracts with the state and utility companies.
?????Lynch said the ongoing investigation has already produced enough=20
information for the PUC and attorney general's office to take legal action=
=20
against the generators next month. The exact nature of that action, she sai=
d,=20
is still under review.
?????Lynch, who is an attorney, did not name specific suppliers or provide=
=20
documentation of her assertions. She said that information will remain=20
confidential until court proceedings are undertaken.
?????Generators have long denied any attempt at manipulating the power mark=
et=20
in any unlawful way, including orchestrating plant shutdowns. They say the=
=20
facilities are so old and have been run so hard during the power crisis tha=
t=20
breakdowns are a recurring problem.
?????Lynch and Gov. Gray Davis, who has been particularly critical of=20
out-of-state generators, have not suggested that every plant shutdown has=
=20
been unwarranted.
?????In fact, the governor's top advisor on power plants released a stateme=
nt=20
last week saying inspectors determined that a Bay Area plant shutdown was=
=20
justified and that the company's officials were ""accommodating.""
?????State Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer was not available for comment on his joi=
nt=20
investigation with the PUC. A spokesman would only confirm that Lockyer's=
=20
office is investigating plant shutdowns as part of a wide-ranging probe of=
=20
possible civil and criminal violations.
?????So far, the attorney general's office has subpoenaed documents in 91=
=20
categories from generators, including records of plant operations, pricing=
=20
practices and information the merchants may have shared with one another=20
about California's power market.
?????""We're looking for behavior that would violate antitrust or unfair=20
business practice laws,"" Lockyer has told The Times.
?????Although he has not provided details of his office's findings, he=20
recently said the inquiry is ""beginning to get interesting.""
?????Lynch said evidence of allegedly unnecessary plant shutdowns was amass=
ed=20
during interviews by investigators and in a review of the voluminous=20
subpoenaed records, obtained after intense legal battles with the power=20
companies.
?????In addition, investigators have been entering plants where unplanned=
=20
shutdowns have occurred to examine operations and maintenance records, Lync=
h=20
said. At times, the investigators have been denied access and have had to=
=20
exert legal pressure to get in, she said.=20
?????The plant shutdowns are a key factor in the soaring power prices, whic=
h=20
have gone from $200 a megawatt-hour in December to as high as $1,900 last=
=20
week.
?????""I would argue it's no accident,"" Lynch said of the high prices. ""That=
=20
in fact it's [due to] the coordinated behavior of a cartel.""
?????The power generators have repeatedly said they have acted within the=
=20
rules of California's flawed deregulation program, which allowed them to bu=
y=20
power plants formerly run by the state's three largest utilities.
?????Gary Ackerman, a spokesman for a trade association of large power=20
producers, said Lynch's allegations were ""the height of idiocy.""
?????The reason many plants have been down in recent months, he said, is th=
at=20
power producers must perform maintenance now in anticipation of heavy summe=
r=20
demand.
?????He said he doubted that state investigators could prove wrongdoing=20
because there was no conspiracy to turn off supplies.
?????""My members do not make money by shutting down their plants so their=
=20
competitors can make money,"" said Ackerman, executive director of the Weste=
rn=20
Power Trading Forum.
?????State analysts have argued, however, that power traders can reap=20
extraordinary profits by withholding power because the prices for the power=
=20
that is sold are so high.
?????According to Lynch, investigators have found that some companies were=
=20
more aggressive than others in allegedly using plant shutdowns to manipulat=
e=20
the state's power market.
?????She said investigators have also found a suspicious pattern: When=20
operators of the state electricity grid declare a Stage 1 alert--meaning th=
at=20
electricity reserves have dropped below 7%--plants that do not need repairs=
=20
suddenly are yanked offline. That, she said, aggravates the shortages, and=
=20
the cost of wholesale electricity soars.
?????Before December, state analysts alleged that power traders had driven =
up=20
prices primarily through bidding. At the time, the market was designed to p=
ay=20
all power suppliers the highest amount accepted by the state's grid operato=
r.
?????That changed in December, when new federal regulations restructured=20
California's wholesale power market to loosen price controls, Lynch said.=
=20
Since then, a new pattern of plant shutdowns has emerged--""not coincidental=
ly=20
in my view,"" she said. Now, she added, the state has endured ""historically=
=20
high levels of unplanned plant outages.""
?????The investigation is not focusing on power plants still operated by=20
utility companies because they have not been ""going off [line] at record=20
levels,"" Lynch said.
?????The California Energy Commission reported last week that the state's=
=20
electrical grid has been sorely tested by plant shutdowns at a rate several=
=20
times higher than in the last two years.
?????A Times analysis of state data found that, throughout the last two=20
months, about 12,000 megawatts of production was offline, more than a third=
=20
of the peak power used in California on a typical day. That has been about=
=20
evenly divided between scheduled and sudden plant shutdowns.
?????By contrast, shutdowns in the same period of 1999 and 2000 took only=
=20
3,300 to 5,700 megawatts offline.

Critics Say Bush Proposal Leaves California in the Dark=20

By JENIFER WARREN and ROBIN FIELDS, Times Staff Writers=20

?????California lawmakers, analysts and others waist-deep in the state's=20
power crisis reached a single conclusion Thursday about the White House=20
energy plan:
?????By the time many of President Bush's proposals kick in, it will be too=
=20
late to do the Golden State much good.
?????""This plan does absolutely nothing to help California get through the=
=20
next critical 18 months,"" groused state Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey)=
.=20
""You can't focus just on the long term here. Because the patient will be de=
ad=20
before we get the life-support systems in place.""
?????Gov. Gray Davis and others say the single best step Bush could take to=
=20
help the state is to impose controls on runaway electricity prices that are=
=20
draining California's treasury and forcing massive utility rate increases.
?????Instead, the president has offered an energy blueprint anchored by an=
=20
expansion in drilling for natural gas and oil, increased reliance on nuclea=
r=20
power and more than $10 billion in tax credits for conservation and energy=
=20
development.
?????Most of Bush's proposals, however, are slow-acting remedies, and many=
=20
others already are being applied in California, which was hit by energy woe=
s=20
far ahead of other states.
?????The plan's dozens of incentive programs designed to boost output or=20
promote conservation cannot be ramped up in time to protect the state from=
=20
blackouts and painful spikes in electricity prices, experts say.
?????""Overall, the message in this plan is, 'Drop dead, California,' "" said=
=20
Eric Heitz of the Energy Foundation, a San Francisco-based research and=20
advocacy group.
?????""I don't think it delivers another megawatt to California,"" added=20
Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission.
?????State economic analysts say the plan fails California by viewing the=
=20
power crisis as an ongoing emergency, rather than a temporary one.=20
California's supply crunch should ease dramatically by summer 2003, once 27=
=20
new power plants--15 of them licensed, 12 in the pipeline--start churning.
?????""It's not that we don't have long-term problems,"" said Stephen Levy,=
=20
director of the Palo Alto-based Center for Continuing Study of the Californ=
ia=20
Economy. ""It's just that energy isn't among them.""
?????Others, including many environmentalists, say Bush could have made a=
=20
noticeable impact by, for example, beefing up energy efficiency programs--a=
=20
quick, clean and relatively inexpensive way to cut demand.
?????""Why not provide aggressive incentives [rebates] to get people to=20
purchase more efficient air conditioners?"" asked Dan Reicher, assistant=20
Energy secretary in the Clinton administration. ""Over the course of the yea=
r,=20
a program like that can make a dramatic difference"" because air conditionin=
g=20
consumes nearly one-third of California's peak energy supply.
?????Instead, Reicher noted, Bush earlier this year rolled back efficiency=
=20
standards for air conditioners, a move that critics say will require the=20
country to build 43 new power plants.
?????Even the few elements of the plan that looked promising for California=
=20
were clouded by doubt.
?????Bush, for example, directed the Energy secretary to explore ways to=20
relieve a key transmission bottleneck, known as ""Path 15,"" between Northern=
=20
and Southern California. But he specified that the upgrade, which requires=
=20
building a 90-mile line at an estimated cost of $225 million, be funded by=
=20
""nonfederal contributions""--meaning the financially strapped utilities migh=
t=20
be expected to bear the cost.
?????Gov. Davis, who lately has stepped up his pleas for help from=20
Washington, said the Bush plan offers too little too late for California an=
d=20
criticized the president for allowing ""the price-gouging energy companies,=
=20
many of which reside in Texas, to get away with murder.""
?????Davis said the state is ""doing everything possible to build and conser=
ve=20
our way out of the problem,"" but it desperately needs federal price control=
s=20
on energy costs. In 1999, California energy users spent about $7 billion;=
=20
this year, even with consumption down 5%, the bill could top $50 billion.
?????But Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, who led the task force that=
=20
prepared the plan, are opposed to price caps, preferring to let market forc=
es=20
reign.
?????Davis said that laissez faire approach puts California's economy in=20
peril.
?????""Just saying, over the long haul, everything will work out is turning =
a=20
blind eye to the bleeding and hemorrhaging that exist in this state,"" Davis=
=20
said. ""Small businesses . . . literally will go out of business because the=
y=20
can't afford these rates.""
?????Analysts who studied the Bush plan say they are particularly=20
disappointed because it covers a lot of ground already plowed by California=
.
?????Bush recommends building 1,900 power plants over the next 20=20
years--about eight plants a month. But California is already on a=20
plant-building spree that will give it a comfortable supply within two year=
s.
?????The president also wants to streamline approval of plants and is pushi=
ng=20
for a renewed commitment to nuclear power. The California governor, however=
,=20
has already ordered expedited licensing of new plants under an executive=20
order issued in February.
?????There is little evidence, meanwhile, that Californians are eager to=20
approve an expansion in nuclear power. Nationwide, not one new nuclear plan=
t=20
has been licensed in more than 20 years. And a Times Poll in February found=
=20
that 60% of Californians oppose more nuclear reactors in the state.

Wall St. Cautious Over Energy Sector's Outlook for Next Year=20
Stocks: Earnings for many oil and natural gas producers are expected to top=

out in 2001 as prices stabilize.=20

By JOSH FRIEDMAN and TOM PETRUNO, Times Staff Writers=20

?????President Bush's energy plan, unveiled Thursday, helped spark a broad=
=20
rally across the energy sector and among firms that stand to benefit by=20
selling equipment and services to oil and natural gas companies.
?????Yet Wall Street has been taking a cautious stance toward energy shares=
=20
in recent months, and Thursday's rally doesn't change much, some analysts a=
nd=20
money managers say.
?????Despite the long-term earnings boost the sector could get under Bush's=
=20
plan, many oil and gas companies are expected to post lower earnings in 200=
2=20
than in 2001, analysts estimate.
?????That reflects expectations that crude oil and natural gas prices will =
at=20
best stabilize at current levels--which are down sharply from their 2000=20
peaks--or head lower.
?????Thus, after heady gains in 1999 and 2000 as oil and gas prices rockete=
d,=20
many energy stocks have stalled this year.
?????The American Stock Exchange index of 15 major natural-gas-related=20
stocks, for example, is down 4% year to date. The Standard & Poor's index o=
f=20
six large oil and gas exploration and production companies has lost 5.3%.
?????Schlumberger (ticker symbol: SLB), a leading oil-field services compan=
y,=20
has seen its shares pull back 15% since Jan. 1, even with a gain of $1.78 t=
o=20
$67.99 on Thursday.
?????By contrast, the blue-chip S&P 500 index is down 2.4% this year.
?????Craig T. Callahan, manager of Icon Energy stock mutual fund and chief=
=20
investment officer at the Icon Funds group, said investors need to be choos=
y=20
to find good buys today in the energy sector.
?????""We're leaning more toward the refiners than the drillers because=20
they're the better bargains,"" he said. ""And at this point the good news loo=
ks=20
fully priced into the services and equipment group.""
?????After betting big on the energy sector in early-1999, Callahan took=20
profits earlier this year. ""We just don't see energy as a leader anymore--i=
ts=20
leadership days are done,"" he said.
?????Callahan shrugged off any potential windfalls from Bush's proposal. ""W=
e=20
look at these companies from the bottom up and pretty much ignore the macro=
=20
trends,"" he said.
?????For the near term, investors have to cope with the prospect that=20
earnings at many energy companies will decline in 2002.
?????Chevron (CHV), for example, is expected to earn $7.20 a share this yea=
r,=20
according to analysts' consensus estimate as tracked by IBES/Thomson=20
Financial. But next year the company's earnings are expected to fall to $6.=
20.
?????At the stock's current price--it rose 41 cents to $95.66 Thursday--the=
=20
price-to-earnings ratio based on estimated 2002 results is 15. That is lowe=
r=20
than the average blue-chip stock P/E of 21, but experts note that energy=20
stocks generally have lower P/Es because of the inherently cyclical nature =
of=20
the business.
?????Still, some analysts believe the Bush energy plan could revive interes=
t=20
in many energy shares, if investors take a longer-term view.
?????Companies that explore for, produce and refine oil and gas could be=20
among the biggest beneficiaries of Bush's initiatives, said Corey McElveen,=
=20
stock analyst at Morningstar Inc. In particular, he cites Phillips Petroleu=
m=20
(P) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), which already have operations in energy-rich=20
Alaska. Phillips rose $1.72 to $65.87 on Thursday, while Exxon Mobil eased =
77=20
cents to $88.73.
?????Callahan, however, favors companies that focus on refining. Ashland=20
(ASH), Pennzoil-Quaker State (PZL) and Sunoco (SUN) are among the refining=
=20
stocks with reasonable valuations and plenty of upside, he said.
?????Ashland eased 17 cents to $43.50 Thursday, Pennzoil-Quaker added 5 cen=
ts=20
to $15.96 and Sunoco rose 98 cents to $41.45.
?????Some money managers prefer to leave the traditional oil and gas stocks=
=20
for others--in favor of alternative energy issues.
?????John Hammerschmidt, manager of Turner New Energy & Power Technology=20
Fund, likes the potential of companies such as Energy Conversion (ENER),=20
which is seeking to develop cheaper and sturdier solar panels, and AstroPow=
er=20
(APWR), another solar firm.
?????Energy Conversion jumped $3.53 to $31.28 on Thursday while AstroPower=
=20
leaped $3.38 to $54.93.
?????In the fuel cell industry, Hammerschmidt pointed to Ballard Power=20
Systems (BLDP), whose products are being used in clean-running buses in Los=

vehicles, as proposed by Bush, ""could be huge"" for such firms, he said.
?????Ballard jumped $8.37 to $57.60 and FuelCell rose $4.98 to $85.28.
?????But fuel cell companies, are, for the most part, far away from=20

Municipal Utilities Seek Exemptions From Blackouts=20
Power: Those connected to state grid, L.A. not among them, say their=20
customers should not be deprived to aid others.=20

By SCOTT GOLD, Times Staff Writer=20

?????A group of California cities that run their own electric utilities and=
=20
have plenty of power to weather the energy crunch this summer will ask the=
=20
federal government today to exempt them from blackouts.
?????Their quiet campaign challenges the very foundation of the power grid =
in=20
California, and could change the dynamics of how electricity is doled=20
out--just as the state is bracing for a summer of rolling outages.
?????Most Californians pay large, investor-owned utilities like Southern=20
California Edison Co. for power. But about a quarter of households, from th=
e=20
tiny desert city of Needles to the state capital, are billed for electricit=
y=20
by cities, counties or local districts that run their own nonprofit=20
utilities. There are 30 ""municipal"" utilities.
?????Four of them--serving Los Angeles, Burbank, Glendale and the Imperial=
=20
Valley, east of San Diego--are independent of the state power grid and do n=
ot=20
face any outages. But the others are required by contract to give electrici=
ty=20
back to the California Independent System Operator, which runs the grid, by=
=20
participating in rolling blackouts--although they have plenty of power to=
=20
serve their customers.
?????""It makes them wonder why they went out and did their jobs,"" said=20
California Municipal Utilities Assn. attorney Tony Braun.
?????These utilities argue that they are suffering for the myopic decisions=
=20
behind the deregulation of California's electricity market and the power=20
shortage.
?????""We believe our power was purchased for the citizens of Riverside and=
=20
that we don't have the right--nor does anyone else--to take it away from th=
em=20
when they need it,"" said Riverside Utilities Director Tom Evans. ""Our=20
customers are being denied something that they are fundamentally entitled t=
o.""
?????Leading the campaign is the tiny Los Angeles County city of Vernon,=20
which filed a complaint last week asking the Federal Energy Regulatory=20
Commission to exempt it from rolling blackouts.
?????Vernon's public utility has 2,000 customers, all but 30 of which are=
=20
industrial operations such as glass manufacturers and meatpacking plants. T=
he=20
city launched its own distribution system primarily to lure industry with=
=20
electric rates that are typically among the lowest in the state, said Jorge=
=20
Somoano, Vernon's assistant director of resource management.
?????FERC set a deadline today for other municipal utilities to support the=
=20
campaign. Up to half, including Riverside, are expected to either file thei=
r=20
own complaints or file documents supporting Vernon, said Washington attorne=
y=20
Bonnie Blair, who represents municipal utilities in Azusa, Banning and Colt=
on.
?????Even the campaign's supporters are unsure whether it will succeed. Bla=
ir=20
acknowledged that there is no precedent for presenting this type of legal=
=20
challenge to FERC, which is expected to decide on the issue by mid-June. An=
d,=20
she said, municipal utilities might have a tough time proving they have don=
e=20
enough to insulate themselves from the energy crisis.
?????Some cities with municipal utilities, such as Anaheim, are not plannin=
g=20
to join the campaign.
?????Marcie Edwards, general manager of Anaheim Public Utilities, said the=
=20
relationships between municipal utilities and Cal-ISO are too complicated t=
o=20
make a clean break. She said it is rare that a power shortage can be blamed=
=20
entirely on the large investor-owned utilities--including this summer's=20
energy crunch. And until that can be proved, she said, municipal utilities=
=20
still have an obligation to support California's power grid.
?????""It's not right to go either way 100%,"" she said. ""The fact remains th=
at=20
municipals still have an obligation to serve.""
?????Most of the municipal utilities are linked to the grid through=20
agreements with Cal-ISO that call for them to share electricity in an=20
emergency.
?????Those utilities tend to believe that the agreements were reserved for=
=20
natural disasters, such as earthquakes, or other sudden and monumental=20
problems, such as a plane running into a transmission line.
?????""The failure or inability of other utilities to schedule sufficient=20
supplies,"" Vernon contended wryly in its papers filed with FERC, does not=
=20
constitute an emergency.
?????""The obligation to share in [rolling blackouts] did not contemplate=20
situations where some utilities were not meeting their basic obligation to=
=20
provide resources to serve their customers,"" Blair said. ""If they are force=
d=20
to participate in rolling blackouts, the effect is that the ISO is taking=
=20
energy that has been bought and paid for by some customers and effectively=
=20
giving it to somebody else that has been unable to buy it.""
?????Jim Detmers, Cal-ISO's vice president of operations, said the=20
organization plans to fight the campaign. He said emergency provisions of=
=20
Cal-ISO's agreements with the municipal utilities cover the current energy=
=20
crunch.
?????Detmers said that exempting municipal utilities from blackouts would=
=20
increase the share of those events shouldered by communities that do not ha=
ve=20
their own electricity distribution. He compared the exemption request to a=
=20
homeowner declining to fight a fire at a neighbor's because he wants to kee=
p=20
his water for himself.
?????""What we're dealing with is an overall shortage,"" Detmers said. ""We wa=
nt=20
to make sure that we are making the right choices when everyone's lives are=
=20
at risk.""
?????Ronald Nunnally, Edison's director of federal regulations and contract=
s,=20
said the municipal utilities have an obligation to uphold the integrity of=
=20
the power grid to which they are connected.
?????""The ability to use the grid requires to keep it whole, if you will,=
=20
under all circumstances,"" he said.
?????Blair said those arguments don't hold up. Indeed, she said the municip=

State energy regulators have uncovered evidence that some electric power=20
companies drove up prices by repeatedly shutting down generating plants for=

Investigators with the California Public Utilities Commission and the state=

What's more, many of those unnecessary plant shutdowns came when California=

utilities, Lynch said.=20
""We are talking about individual acts (of wrongdoing),"" Lynch told The=20

""That's not within the PUC's bailiwick,"" Lynch said last night.=20
Lockyer could not be reached for comment.=20
Although Lynch said investigators have evidence that several companies shut=

INVESTIGATION BEGAN IN AUGUST
Lockyer's office began investigating last August whether power companies ha=
ve=20
been manipulating prices to maximize profits as California struggles with a=

But even if investigators prove that electricity generators are ""gaming"" th=

whether their actions violate the law.=20
Meanwhile, the PUC has been investigating why so many plants are down=20

soaring power prices, which have gone from $200 in December to as high as $=

PG&E Corp., which insists that California's energy woes will end only when=
=20
new power plants are built, will begin construction of five generating=20
facilities this year and has at least four others on the drawing board.=20
Unfortunately for California, not one of these plants will be in the state.=
=20
Rather, PG&E will build more than 9,000 megawatts of new generation -- enou=
gh=20
power to light about 9 million homes -- in New York, New Jersey, Wisconsin,=
=20
Michigan, Arizona, Illinois, Oregon and Nevada.=20
PG&E may talk about the importance of building power plants in California,=
=20
but the simple fact is that the company generally can construct generating=
=20
facilities more quickly and cheaply elsewhere -- and still benefit from hig=
h=20
electricity prices.=20
The company's ambitious building boom was outlined this week at PG&E's annu=
al=20
shareholder meeting in San Francisco.=20
""It is not perceived as advantageous for them to build their plants in=20
California,"" Keith Hannigan, a Chicago lawyer specializing in power plants,=
=20
said yesterday. ""It's naive to think that PG&E will behave in any way excep=

PG&E Corp. has only one major plant under way in its home state: the 1,000-=
=20
megawatt La Paloma facility near Bakersfield, due to begin operating by the=

middle of next year.=20
The company received approval from state authorities last month for a 510-=

Calpine Corp.=20
""The businesses that we have outside California are designed to grow=20
shareholder value,"" PG&E Chairman Robert Glynn told shareholders on=20
Wednesday.=20
Indeed, PG&E's National Energy Group, which oversees the company's power=20
plants, is the corporation's fastest-growing division -- a marked contrast =
to=20
PG&E's cash-strapped utility operations.=20
The National Energy Group saw operating earnings skyrocket by 165 percent=
=20
last year, compared with just 2 percent for the utility and 13 percent for=
=20
the corporation overall.=20
Operating earnings exclude one-time charges related to California's current=
=20
energy crisis.=20
While state officials expressed disappointment that PG&E would build its=20
plants elsewhere, they quickly noted that nothing can be done to change the=
=20
situation.=20
""What the holding company does is different from the regulated utility,"" sa=
id=20
Richard Bilas, a member of the California Public Utilities Commission. ""The=
=20
holding company is able to do things that ain't right for California, but=
=20
that's what they do.""=20
Under California's 1996 deregulation of the state's electricity market, PG&=
E=20
sold off most of its power plants to out-of-state energy companies -- the=
=20
same companies that PG&E now says are gouging California consumers and=20
driving its utility deeper into debt.=20
Meanwhile, PG&E Corp. owns, or holds stakes in, more than 30 power plants i=
n=20
11 states and has been especially aggressive in the New England area, where=
=20
the company now has 21 generating facilities.=20
The largest investor-owned utility in Massachusetts asked federal regulator=
s=20
this week to block PG&E Corp. from raising electricity prices during power=
=20
shortages.=20
PG&E countered that the rates it charges customers in the Boston area are=
=20
""fair and reasonable.""=20
Most power companies say the same about what they are charging California=
=20
consumer these days. Supply and demand, they say, means that prices go up=
=20
when inventories go down.=20
The situation in California is gradually changing. Four new plants,=20
accounting for almost 2,000 megawatts, will begin operating this summer,=20
according to the California Energy Commission.=20
Another four should be online by next year, and seven others are scheduled =
to=20
be up and running by 2004.=20
Total production from all 15 new plants will be about 9,800 megawatts.=20
Yet California's demand for electricity will continue to grow during that=
=20
same period, and the state is expected to continue purchasing power from ou=
t-=20
of-state sources.=20
One of those sources could be PG&E. The company is in the final stages of=
=20
securing permits for a 1,000-megawatt plant near Las Vegas -- one of nearly=
 a=20
dozen generating facilities being fast-tracked by Nevada authorities to mak=

Nevada's primary goal is to secure enough electricity for the state's glitz=

Washington -- President Bush warned yesterday that California's blackouts a=

a ""preview"" for the rest of the nation if it fails to increase energy=20
supplies, but his plan to do so met with a hail of ridicule from=20
environmental groups and Democrats.=20
So quick and fierce were the attacks that the Bush plan may do less to ease=
=20
public concerns about energy than to set off an all-out political war with=
=20
environmentalists and their Democratic allies.=20
""If we fail to act, this great country could face a darker future, a future=
=20
that is unfortunately being previewed in rising prices at the gas pump and=

punitive, less rancorous.""=20
""We've yelled at each other enough,"" Bush said. ""Now it's time to listen to=

each other and to act.""=20
But no sooner did Bush release his plan than it met a barrage of criticism=
=20
from environmental groups and Democrats who set up ""war rooms"" in the=20
basement of the Capitol and derided the plan as a payoff to the energy=20
industry.=20
Greenpeace activists dumped a heap of coal and oil drums outside Vice=20

Gov. Gray Davis joined the fray from Sacramento. ""By not doing anything,=20

White House press secretary Ari Fleischer acknowledged that Bush has a=20

Bush's plan calls for easing regulatory barriers to more nuclear power, mor=

CALL FOR NATIONWIDE GRID
Citing California's infamous ""Path 15"" transmission bottleneck that keeps=

of a national grid, condemning private property if necessary to make way fo=
r=20
new transmission lines.=20
""Highways connect Miami with Seattle, phone lines link Los Angeles and New=

While promising no quick relief for high gasoline prices, Bush said his pla=
n=20
to review the dozen different ""boutique"" fuel blends required by varying=20
environmental rules would help ease limitations on refinery production.=20
And he vowed that new technologies can make conservation painless.=20
""Conservation does not mean doing without,"" Bush said, citing such things a=

people leave a room. ""Wise regulation and American innovation will make thi=

Bush's conciliatory language was a twist on former President Bill Clinton's=
=20
oft-used rhetoric to fend off criticism from the right that environmental=
=20
protection would cost jobs.=20
GREEN GROUPS MOBILIZE
While Bush is trying to keep those on the left at bay, environmental groups=
=20
promised an intense effort to kill the president's plan.=20
Bush ""creates a thin veil of energy efficiency to hide a cesspool of=20
political giveaways"" to the energy industry, said Dan Becker of the Sierra=
=20
Club.=20
Sen. Dianne Feinstein and nearly every other Democrat in the California=20
delegation attacked the plan as doing nothing to aid California, urging=20
electricity price controls instead.=20
""For Big Oil and other suppliers, the Bush energy plan is a dream come true=

"" Feinstein said. ""But among those most left behind are the people and=20

PLAN'S PROSPECTS IN CONGRESS
The Bush plan is likely to ignite a free-for-all in Congress to divvy up=20
benefits among competing energy sources ranging from coal and nuclear power=

President Bush compared his new energy policy yesterday to President=20
Eisenhower's vision of an interstate highway program, but presidents have=
=20
been down the energy road many times before.=20
In the days when American resources seemed limitless, the federal governmen=
t=20
had a limited role in energy policy.=20
This started to change in the 1930s, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt's=
=20
New Deal developed the Tennessee Valley Authority, which built dams and=20
generated 100 billion kilowatt hours of electricity, and the Bonneville pow=
er=20
project on the Columbia River, which supplies the Pacific Northwest - and=
=20
California - with electricity.=20
New energy policies and debates about national resources seem to come and g=
o=20
like the tide. Here is a look at presidents and their policies: .=20
Dwight Eisenhower=20
In World War II, the United States developed the most fearsome of all energ=
y=20
sources: nuclear fission. Nuclear weapons killed at least 280,000 people=20
in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and held the world under the threat of destructio=
n.=20
In December of 1953, President Eisenhower in his famous ""Atoms for Peace""=
=20
speech at the United Nations, proposed an international pool for the=20
development of the peaceful uses of nuclear power.=20
One result: Congress passed the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, for a public-=20
private development of nuclear power. The Navy developed nuclear submarines=
,=20
but only one nuclear civilian ship, the freighter Savannah, was ever built.=
=20
It was not a success. .=20
Lyndon Johnson=20
The Johnson years are more remembered for his Great Society programs and th=
e=20
war in Vietnam, but it was also a boom time for commercial nuclear power.=
=20
However, there were growing questions about safety, and disposal of waste.=
=20
In 1965 came the great blackout - a massive power failure on the East Coast=
,=20
the first sign of a major energy problem. .=20
Richard Nixon=20
Nixon was the first president to send an energy message to Congress. His 19=
71=20
message sounds eerily familiar: He said the country could not take its ener=
gy=20
supply for granted. He wanted a department of natural resources, but the pl=
an=20
went nowhere, since gas was cheap and so was electricity.=20
In 1973, Nixon asked for a department of energy. An Arab oil boycott spurre=
d=20
the launch of a new energy program, called Project Independence. Nixon want=
ed=20
Americans to lower their thermostats, drive their cars more slowly, turn do=
wn=20
the lights. There were long lines at gas stations. Nixon compared his progr=
am=20
to save energy to other great projects, like landing men on the moon.=20
Nixon, who was being overwhelmed by the Watergate crisis, announced that th=
e=20
energy crisis had been solved in March, 1974. In August, he resigned. .=20
Jimmy Carter=20
The energy problem was one of the overwhelming factors that spoiled Carter'=
s=20
presidency. Carter, who had emphasized his role as a nuclear engineer,=20
announced an era of limits on American energy use. He asked Americans to sa=
ve=20
energy, and to turn down the heat. His famous television address on energy,=
=20
which showed the President wearing a coat, sweater and looking grim, was a=
=20
defining negative image of his administration. .=20
Ronald Reagan=20
The new president's solution to the energy crisis was to abolish the=20
cabinet-level Department of Energy - but he never succeeded. He also=20
rescinded Carter's order to turn down government building thermostats. Ener=
gy=20
policy, he thought, was best made by the free market.=20
James Watt, his secretary of the Interior, urged development of federally=
=20
protected natural resources for energy use. The policy backfired as the=20
environmental movement used Watt's words against him.=20
Meanwhile, Secretary of Energy James Edwards proclaimed that the energy=20
crisis was over. .=20
George H.W. Bush=20
On July 26, 1989, President Bush announced a new comprehensive energy=20
strategy. The country would rely on market forces, environmental protection=
s,=20
and fairly priced energy. It was one of the administration's top priorities=
.=20
In the meantime, in August, 1990, the policy was overtaken by events, when=
=20
Iraq invaded Kuwait and threatened Saudi Arabia. Had the Iraqis taken the=
=20
Saudi oil fields, they would have controlled 40 percent of the world's oil=
=20
supply. The result was an ultimatum to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.=
=20
When that was ignored, the Gulf War followed. .=20
Bill Clinton=20
Among Clinton's pledges was one to ""Reinvent government."" While the elder=
=20
President Bush's secretary of energy claimed he had overhauled the departme=
nt=20
and made it the finest in the government, Hazel O'Leary, Clinton's choice f=
or=20
secretary of energy, found it was ""a mess.""=20
The Department of Energy, Clinton said, had been ""sorely underutilized."" Fo=
r=20
decades, Clinton said, energy was ""the Achilles' heel"" of the economy. He=

Included in the Bush administration's 163-page energy plan is a call for ta=

credits to spur the development of biomass, a form of energy generation tha=

spans everything from old-style wood burning to futuristic processes such a=

extracting ethanol from agricultural waste.=20
Although Bush envisions biomass playing a tiny role in solving the nation's=

immediate energy woes, high-level support for the technology could be=20
important for two California industries: biotechnology and agriculture.=20
Sharon Shoemaker, director of the California Institute of Food and=20
Agricultural Research at the University of California at Davis, is a=20
proponent of using biotechnology to reinvent biomass as an industry. The ai=
m=20
is to extract clean energy and mineral byproducts from plant waste, while=

""There's no commercial (biomass) plant like this out there yet, but we're=

just on the verge of making it happen,"" said Shoemaker, who will hold a=20
biomass conference at Davis in June.=20
California's biomass industry, which contributes about 1.5 percent of the=
=20
state's electricity, is based primarily on burning waste wood from sawmills=
,=20
forests and orchards.=20
The keys to reinventing biomass are genetically engineered bacteria and=20
bioengineered enzymes that can turn cellulose -- the material that gives=20
plants their strength -- into ethanol in a process similar to fermenting=20
grain or grapes into alcohol.=20
In addition to producing ethanol to blend with gasoline, new biomass=20
breweries would extract valuable minerals from plants and even convert the=

states that would benefit most from biomass techniques that provide new=20

The policy rationale for biomass energy was laid out in a 1999 article titl=

The nation annually consumes about 120 billion gallons of gasoline and=20

The new biomass fever must be tempered by recognition that today's biomass=
=20
industry is controversial and subsidized, and the futuristic processing=20
plants envisioned by boosters exist only in the pilot stage.=20
California, for instance, has 29 biomass plants in operation, fueled=20
primarily by wood waste, Morris said. An equal number of biomass plants has=
=20
been idled or dismantled for a variety of reasons, including a lack of wood=
=20
for fuel. The fastest way to ramp up the wood supply would be thinning the=
=20
state's forests, but that could stir environmental opposition, Morris said.=
=20
In the Midwest, biomass has a different, though no less controversial,=20
meaning. In the grain-producing states, biomass means turning corn kernels=
=20
into ethanol. The same kernels that might get popped in the movie theater o=
r=20
fed to the livestock are instead put through an ethanol conversion plant.=
=20
Two factors make this possible. First, corn kernels are rich in starch, whi=

is relatively easy to ferment. The stalks and the cobs -- which contain the=

Second -- and steeped in controversy -- is a 53-cent-per-gallon federal=20

Today's high energy prices and shortages are driving massive energy-industr=

To call the current situation a crisis is an exaggeration, with the excepti=

temporary blackouts this summer and possibly next. It pales in comparison=

with the 1970s crises that forced motorists to line up for limited gasoline=

supplies and drove the U.S. economy into recession.=20
``There's an electricity crisis in California,'' said Paul Krugman, a=20
Princeton University economist. ``Nothing else out there justifies talking=

about a crisis. Energy demand surged in the late 1990s and the capacity for=

But even today's high gasoline prices, when adjusted for inflation, are 30=

Consumers enjoyed a period of extremely low energy prices for most of the=

=20
and drivers are likely to be saddled with higher prices for gasoline, heati=
ng=20
oil and natural gas for months and maybe a few years.=20
While higher energy costs always pose a threat to the overall economy, it's=
 a=20
much more distant one today than in the 1970s. Then, oil prices soared 200=

By comparison, energy costs rose 35 percent last year and are projected to=
=20
rise an additional 9 percent this year, according to DRI-WEFA, a Lexington,=
=20
Mass., economic-forecasting firm.=20
``We're better off today, because we have a much more diversified energy=20

The country is much less dependent on oil, particularly for electricity=20

=20
-- the growth in energy use.=20
The one risk is California.=20
``In the end, disaster probably will be avoided, but it's going to be=20
nasty,'' Krugman said.=20
Outside California, the outlook is much less bleak. Power companies have=20
built or significantly expanded 123 power plants in the past 14 months,=20
according to Resource Data International, a Boulder, Colo.-based=20
energy-information and -consulting firm. An additional 197 are under=20

That pace of construction is enough to meet the upper end of the Bush=20

``We are on the right road and we are building up front a lot of what is=20

Likewise, the natural-gas market is adjusting to recent supply shortages th=

``As the price rises, there's economic incentive to drill more,'' said Gary=

Flaharty, director of investor relations for Baker Hughes. ``Eventually=20
you'll drill to the point where there is enough gas on the market and the=

Still, future gas supply will have to keep up with new demand from the=20

To meet that expected demand, most analysts support construction of a=20

The plan, which includes a pledge to speed up power plant permits and=20

who accused the administration of ``turning a blind eye to the bleeding and=

``If he wants to be helpful to California, he could send a strong signal th=

Southern California Edison, will see unprecedented rate increases soon.=20
In announcing his plan Thursday, Bush warned that California is previewing=

the power troubles the nation could face if it doesn't boost its energy=20
supply and cut demand.=20
``Californians are learning, regrettably, that sometimes when you flick on=
=20
the light switch, the light does not come on at any price,'' Bush said.=20
He said his energy plan provides solutions that will help ease the state's=

power woes.=20
``I'm deeply concerned about the impact of blackouts on the daily lives of=

the good people of the state of California, and my administration is=20
committed to helping California,'' Bush said.=20
Some consumers didn't see the president's sympathy.=20
``I don't really think he has my concerns as his priority,'' said Jodi=20
Reynolds, 38, a Culver City legal secretary. ``I can already see that I nee=
d=20
to conserve energy. I don't need the president to tell me that.''=20
Others gave Bush credit for addressing the nation's long-term energy needs,=
=20
but faulted the president for not doing more for California now.=20
``We give him kudos for addressing the supply issue,'' said Brian Bennett,=
=20
vice president of external affairs for Southern California Edison, one of t=
he=20
state's cash-strapped electric utilities.=20
``However, when it comes to addressing the California crisis, the Bush=20
administration has chosen to ignore what they could have done to help lesse=
n=20

That theme ran through some of the comments by the state's environmental an=

``In the last energy crisis, a handful of nations in the Middle East had us=

The Bush plan also steps away from assurances he made during the campaign=
=20
that he would not rescind a moratorium on new offshore oil leases created b=

his father and extended until 2012 by President Clinton. The plan calls for=

Some utility and government officials said Bush correctly focused on=20
expanding the nation's energy infrastructure, building more natural gas=20
pipelines and strengthening the electricity transmission grid.=20
But the president's support for new nuclear power plants won little support=
.=20
``The political realities in California are we're not going to see an=20
increased reliance to nuclear power in the near future,'' said Carl Wood, a=
=20
member of the California Public Utilities Commission.=20
Perhaps predictably, state Democrats found little to like in Bush's plan,=
=20
while Republicans found much to praise.=20
``The president's plan will help California this summer by expediting new=

FTCR/ Bush Energy Plan Will Make California Crisis Worse; Taxpayer=20
Boondoggles, More Deregulation Equals Higher Prices, Taxes



LOS ANGELES, May 17, 2001 (U.S. Newswire via COMTEX)  via NewsEdge=20
Corporation  - The Bush-Cheney energy
plan will make things worse for beleaguered Californians, who are facing an
economic and public health catastrophe this summer as a result of=20
deregulation,
a California-based citizen group said today.

""California's facing a catastrophe because a handful of energy companies ha=
ve
seized control of our electricity supply under deregulation, and have been
manipulating the supply of electricity to create artificial shortages and
maximize their profits,"" said Harvey Rosenfield, president of the non-profi=
t
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. ""The federal government could=
=20
stop
this assault and order rate reductions and refunds of overcharges. Instead,=
=20
the
Bush-Cheney plan calls for more deregulation, massive tax breaks for energy
companies and the construction of multi-billion dollar boondoggles like=20
nuclear
power, all of which will benefit the same energy companies that are holding
California hostage.""


With Bush-Cheney Plan, Crisis History Repeats Itself


FTCR noted that the last energy ""crisis"" to strike America was inspired not=
 by
supply shortages but by greed -- of the OPEC nations, which in the 1970s us=
ed
their control of petroleum supplies to create shortages and massive price=
=20
hikes.
American energy companies took advantage to profit from their resources as=
=20
well.
In response, the U.S. Congress passed a then-staggering multi-billion dolla=
r
billion package of tax breaks and grants to the energy industry to build po=
wer
plants that would manufacture ""synthetic fuels."" These plants ultimately=20
became
taxpayer-funded boondoggles, while nuclear power, hailed by the energy=20
industry
as a source of clean energy, turned out to be prohibitively expensive and a
public health threat.


Ironically, California's 1996 deregulation law required ratepayers to pay o=
ff
over $20 billion of the California utility companies' bad debts, most of wh=
ich
were incurred by the utilities as cost-overruns in construction of nuclear=
=20
power
plants in the 1970s.


""California's economy, health and safety, and the quality of life in the=20
Golden
State are threatened by the skyrocketing energy prices inspired by=20
deregulation.
The Bush-Cheney plan not only does nothing to protect us against the energy
cartel, it calls for more deregulation, higher taxes and prices,"" said
Rosenfield.


""In the last energy crisis, a handful of nations in the Middle East created=
 a
cartel to exploit their control over energy supplies; two decades later, a
handful of energy companies from the Southern United States have created a
cartel to exploit their control over our electricity supply,"" said Rosenfie=
ld.
""The only solution to the current crisis is to break the cartel: to bust th=
e
Texas-based OPEC.""

PG&E's CEO faces off with angry shareholders at company's annual meeting




meeting&lt;

AP Business Writer=3D


SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ PG&amp;E Corp. chief executive Robert Glynn
brushed off the scorn of shareholders burned by the company's
bankrupt utility during a prickly annual meeting that ended with
three consumer activists being dragged out of the auditorium by
security officers.


Throughout out the two-hour meeting, Glynn repeatedly sought to
reassure the sometimes hostile audience of nearly 500 people that
the San Francisco-based company remained a solid long-term
investment despite the bankruptcy of its main revenue source,
Pacific Gas and Electric.


He repeated previous promises that the company intends to
recover most, if not all, of its dlrs 9 billion in unreimbursed
electricity expenses accumulated since May 2000, allowing the
utility to regain its financial footing and repay its more than
150,000 creditors.


The company is seeking rulings in bankruptcy court and other
legal venues that might open the door for the utility to
retroactively charge its customers for above-market electricity
bought from June 2000 through February of this year.


``We are not seeking a bailout, a rescue or a handout,'' Glynn
said.


Glynn's arguments didn't seem to win over many shareholders,
some of whom worried that it would take 10 years for the company's
shares to climb back above dlrs 30 _ the stock's value less than
nine months ago. PG&amp;E's stock closed Wednesday at dlrs 11, down 55
cents.


Shareholders this year also missed out on their first quarterly
dividend since World War I.


Several investors lambasted PG&amp;E's nine-member board of
directors and the company's auditors, Deloitte and Touche, but most
shareholders saved their harshest words for Glynn and his executive
team.


``The truth of the matter is you all should be fired for
incompetence,'' Orinda resident Clyde Vaughn, 79, told Glynn.


PG&amp;E agreed to an electricity rate freeze beginning in 1998 as
part of California's electricity deregulation. From January 1998
through May 2000, PG&amp;E's utility made a dlrs 2.7 billion operating
profit on electricity because the frozen customer rates were
usually much higher than the prices on the wholesale market until
last summer.

WASHINGTON -- Every energy executive in America would have liked a half-hou=
r=20
with Vice President Dick Cheney as he fashioned the Bush administration's=
=20
national energy program. Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay got it.=20
Mr. Lay used the time to set out an eight-point agenda intended, among othe=
r=20
things, to head off price controls on wholesale electricity, provide Enron=
=20
and other energy traders with unfettered access to the nation's=20
electricity-transmission system and remove regulatory obstacles to building=
=20
new generating plants and power lines. The energy plan President Bush=20
unveiled yesterday reflected many of those same priorities.=20
In an interview last week, the vice president said he also met with other=
=20
energy executives, but Mr. Lay was the only one he named. Mr. Cheney says h=
e=20
sought Mr. Lay's advice because ""Enron has a different take than most energ=
y=20
companies.""=20
Indeed, Enron Corp. is a modern paradox. It has transformed itself over the=
=20
past 15 years from a stodgy gas-pipeline operator into the nation's largest=
=20
trader of gas and electricity and a formidable player in newer markets such=
=20
as telecommunications services and emissions-reduction credits. Today, it's=
=20
the quintessential model of a company dedicated to free markets.=20
Yet as much as any company in the U.S., it has cultivated close ties with=
=20
government. Since the late 1980s, the Houston-based company, which was=20
President George W. Bush's biggest corporate campaign donor, has beefed up=
=20
its lobbying staff, boosted its political contributions and sought out=20
friends in the world of politics. Now, with Mr. Bush in the White House, it=
=20
is in a unique position to see whether those efforts will pay off.=20
Enron's lobbying blitz reflects one of the ironies of the era of=20
deregulation. Just as government created immense telephone, electric and ga=
s=20
monopolies early in the last century, Enron and other players feel they nee=
d=20
the government's help in opening up those monopolies and gaining access to=
=20
once-closed markets.=20
In particular, Enron wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ensu=
re=20
that energy is deregulated on terms favorable to the company. Rather than=
=20
having the nation's transmission lines controlled by the utilities, it want=
s=20
those lines to provide open access for new entrants such as Enron eager to=
=20
buy and sell power.=20
Mr. Lay is on a first-name basis with a half-dozen members of the Bush=20
cabinet and knows many senior White House staffers from their days in the=
=20
Texas governor's mansion with Mr. Bush. Before joining the administration,=
=20
both White House economist Lawrence Lindsey and U.S. Trade Representative=
=20
Robert Zoellick were on Enron's advisory board, which pays members an annua=
l=20
stipend of $50,000.=20
Under Mr. Lay, Enron has donated nearly $2 million to Mr. Bush during his=
=20
political career. Since the start of the 2000 campaign, Enron and its=20
employees have contributed $1.3 million to the Bush presidential drive, the=
=20
Republican Party and the presidential inauguration, says the Center for=20
Responsive Politics. Enron also accounted for $461,000 in contributions=20
during Mr. Bush's two runs for governor, according to the Center for Public=
=20
Integrity.=20
Mr. Lay, who holds a doctorate in economics, says all he wants from=20
government is a fair shake. Enron supports candidates ""you believe in,"" he=
=20
says. ""You believe in their value system, you believe in their philosophy a=
nd=20
you believe they'll do the right things as leaders.""=20
But it's clear that Mr. Lay wants more than that from government. For now, =
he=20
is focusing on FERC, where he worked in the early 1970s when the agency was=
=20
known as the Federal Power Commission. He hopes to make FERC his ally in=20
beating back the power of utilities. Long dismissed as a regulatory backwat=
er=20
overseeing wholesale transactions by electric and gas utilities, the=20
commission has emerged as the chief navigator of the nation's transition to=
 a=20
fully deregulated energy marketplace.=20
Even before Mr. Bush took office, FERC had begun to rein in the market powe=
r=20
of utilities. In December, FERC told the nation's utilities that it wanted=
=20
them to voluntarily surrender their high-voltage lines -- those that can=20
dispatch electricity across state lines -- to independent grid operators,=
=20
such as those already in place in California and the Northeast, which would=
=20
provide open access to the lines. Although it told the utilities to submit=
=20
plans for doing so, many of them have been reluctant to relinquish control =
of=20
their lines to such independent organizations.=20
Mr. Lay wants FERC to go further, forcing the utilities to cede direct=20
control of their lines. He also is seeking rules that would end what he cal=
ls=20
energy ""balkanization"" and create ""seamless"" interstate electricity markets=
.=20
""Enron is the biggest gas and electric company entirely dependent on the=20
competitive side of the business,"" says Andre Meade, an analyst for=20
Commerzbank. ""To the extent deregulation slows down, their business slows=
=20
down.""=20
Right now it's a lucrative strategy. Enron typically targets tightly=20
controlled markets just as they are opening up, using its financial clout a=
nd=20
risk-management savvy to gain a dominant market position. In doing so, it=
=20
frequently portrays itself as an insurgent taking on entrenched interests.=
=20
In electricity, for instance, Enron buys the output of generating plants,=
=20
sometimes days, weeks or years before the power is actually produced. Using=
=20
sophisticated weather data, it determines the most lucrative market for the=
=20
power, finds a buyer and then arranges delivery via transmission lines owne=
d=20
by others. It hedges its positions with other contracts. Its wholesale=20
trading volume climbed 55% for natural gas and more than doubled for=20
electricity in the first quarter alone. Such growth pushed Enron's wholesal=
e=20
energy-trading income, before taxes and interest, up more than threefold to=
=20
$785 million during the first quarter.=20
Between 1996 and 2000, Enron's yearly net income nearly doubled to $979=20
million and its revenue increased almost eightfold to $100.8 billion. Over=
=20
the same period, Enron's stock price, adjusted for splits, rose more than=
=20
fourfold.=20
At the start of the Bush administration, FERC's future was very much up for=
=20
grabs. Two of the five seats on the commission were vacant, and Enron quick=
ly=20
sought to fill them with activist Republicans. President Bush named a frien=
d=20
of his and Enron's to one of those seats: Texas utility-regulator Pat Wood.=
=20
Mr. Wood had worked closely with Enron during a six-year effort to open=20
Texas' retail electricity market. Mr. Wood also had shown the kind of=20
backbone Enron wanted in a separate fight over telephone deregulation when =
he=20
insisted on closely monitoring phone utilities to make sure they opened the=
ir=20
networks to competitors.=20
For the second slot, Enron backed Nora Mead Brownell, a Pennsylvania utilit=
y=20
regulator. She had come to Enron's aid in 1997 when she voted to block an=
=20
electricity-market restructuring plan backed by Philadelphia's utility and =
by=20
GOP Gov. Tom Ridge. Enron argued that the plan would have locked it out of=
=20
the Philadelphia market.=20
Enron worked to raise Ms. Brownell's visibility by lobbying the House=20
Commerce Committee to include her as an expert witness on energy issues and=
=20
as a member of an informal advisory group, say Enron and congressional aide=
s.=20
Mr. Lay provided heavyweight support. He says Enron included Ms. Brownell's=
=20
name on its ""priority list"" of a half-dozen prospective FERC nominees. And=
=20
when her candidacy ran into opposition from Pennsylvania officials with=20
bitter memories of her 1997 decision, Mr. Lay says he phoned Karl Rove, the=
=20
White House's top political strategist, to tell him that ""she was a strong=
=20
force in getting the right outcome"" in Pennsylvania.""=20
A White House spokeswoman says that a number of individuals and industry=20
groups weighed in in favor of Ms. Brownell, but she declined to name any. M=
s.=20
Brownell says she was unaware of any concerted Enron campaign on her behalf=
.=20
She didn't ask the White House who had supported her because, she says, ""I=
=20
didn't want to be beholden.""=20
Meanwhile, Enron was using its Democratic contacts to strengthen its ties=
=20
with Linda Breathitt, a Kentucky Democrat on the commission. Earlier this=
=20
spring, the company hired two of former Vice President Al Gore's closest=20
friends as lobbyists: Nashville lawyer Charles Bones and Mr. Gore's=20
campaign-finance director, Johnny Hayes. Both had come to know Ms. Breathit=
t=20
through Democratic politics.=20
Ms. Breathitt says she wasn't very familiar with Enron's interests, but tha=
t=20
she accepted when Mr. Hayes invited her to dinner at a Washington restauran=
t=20
in April to meet Richard Shapiro, Enron's managing director for government=
=20
affairs. ""Everyone likes to get to know the FERC commissioners,"" Ms.=20
Breathitt says, adding that she always pays for her own meals.=20
Enron has long played this kind of insider's game. Mr. Lay has been friendl=
y=20
with both Democratic and Republican administrations over the past 25 years,=
=20
sharing time on the links with Presidents Bill Clinton and Gerald Ford. He'=
s=20
been a particularly close friend of the Bush family. In the late 1980s, he=
=20
ran then-Vice President George H.W. Bush's fund-raising drives in Texas.=20
After the younger Bush became governor, he appointed Mr. Lay to run the=20
influential Governor's Business Council. Mr. Lay also made Enron's fleet of=
=20
corporate jets available to the new governor and won his help in lobbying=
=20
officials considering Enron projects.=20
In March 1997, Mr. Lay wrote Gov. Bush to ask that he lobby the Texas=20
congressional delegation to support export-finance credits critical to Enro=
n,=20
according to letters released by the Texas State Archivist's office. In Apr=
il=20
1997, when Enron was negotiating a $2 billion natural-gas joint venture in=
=20
Uzbekistan, Mr. Lay wrote to thank the governor for meeting with the=20
Uzbekistani ambassador to the U.S. Six months later, another Lay thank-you=
=20
note concerned a phone call Mr. Bush made to Pennsylvania Gov. Ridge to=20
support Enron's plan to enter the Philadelphia electricity market. ""I am=20
certain it will have a positive impact,"" Mr. Lay wrote.=20
Mr. Lay says he hasn't sought Mr. Bush's aid directly since Mr. Bush won th=
e=20
presidency. Last month, he talked with the president briefly at a Houston=
=20
benefit for the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy, on which Mr. L=
ay=20
serves as co-chairman. ""It's not a matter of us going off hunting or fishin=
g=20
or sitting around and having drinks,"" he says.=20
Not all Mr. Lay's initiatives have been successful. When Mr. Bush reneged i=
n=20
March on a campaign pledge to fight global warming by requiring reductions =
in=20
carbon-dioxide levels produced by burning hydrocarbons, Mr. Lay says he=20
telephoned Mr. Cheney to complain. ""The scientific evidence, although=20
certainly not conclusive, is pretty compelling that there could be a=20
climate-change problem,"" he says he told the vice president. ""The=20
administration should still look very seriously at it.""=20
Around the same time, Mr. Lay also called Mr. Rove, the White House politic=
al=20
adviser, to urge him to talk to Fred Krupp, the head of the moderate=20
Environmental Defense Fund. Messrs. Krupp and Rove spoke briefly but found=
=20
little common ground. Later, Enron, which has plans to add emission credits=
=20
to the commodities it trades, joined a coalition urging mandatory reduction=
s=20
in carbon-dioxide levels.=20
But Enron saved its main lobbying push for Mr. Cheney's energy task force. =
In=20
April, Mr. Lay met with the panel's staff director, Andrew Lundquist, and=
=20
later, with Mr. Cheney, whom Mr. Lay had come to know well when the vice=20
president was chief of Halliburton Co., a Dallas construction company. ""We=
=20
built Enron Field together,"" says Mr. Lay, referring to Houston's new=20
ballpark.=20
In both meetings, say Enron and White House officials, Mr. Lay presented a=
=20
broad agenda for opening up the nation's electrical system and used the=20
gas-transmission system as a point of comparison. In both cases, he argues,=
=20
pipelines and transmission lines should be like the federal highway system=
=20
that offers easy access to all.=20
The Cheney report uses similar language, describing the electrical grid as=
=20
""the highway for interstate commerce in electricity."" As Enron sought, the=
=20
report directs the energy secretary to determine by the end of the year=20
whether it makes sense to establish a national grid, and to identify=20
bottlenecks in the transmission system as well as how to remove them. An=20
effort to make the grid national would enhance FERC's power, as Enron has=
=20
urged.=20
The report is mum on some Enron concerns, such as requiring utilities to jo=
in=20
regional transmission organizations, an idea strongly opposed by the utilit=
y=20
industry. A White House aide says the task force didn't want to get involve=
d=20
in such battles between industries.=20
As solid as its support in the White House has turned out to be, Enron is=
=20
worried about the backlash against electricity deregulation in Western stat=
es=20
and possibly in New York, should electricity rates surge this summer. Nevad=
a=20

=20
wholesale-electricity prices in neighboring California were undermining the=

Golden State's economy. California and Oregon are contemplating=20
state-government purchases of major utility assets.=20
Enron's biggest fear is that the political pressure will lead the states, o=
r=20
perhaps Congress, to control prices, which could undermine Enron's business=
.=20
In response, Enron has formed a coalition with eight other energy marketers=
=20
in New York, who each have pledged $50,000 to pay for a media and lobbying=
=20
campaign. It also has hired former Montana Gov. Marc Racicot and dispatched=

NEVADA, Iowa, May 17 -- President Bush began an intensive effort today to=
=20
sell his plan for developing new sources of energy to Congress and the=20
American people, arguing that the country had a future of ''energy=20
abundance'' if it could break free of the traditional antagonism between=20
energy producers and environmental advocates.=20
Mr. Bush's plea for a new dialogue came as his administration published the=
=20
report of an energy task force containing scores of specific proposals --=
=20
many that he can impose by executive order -- for finding new sources of=20
power and encouraging a range of new energy technologies.=20
His critics swarmed over the specifics, noting that the plan set no targets=
=20
for improved energy efficiency, offered no short-term relief for=20
out-of-control electricity prices in the West and provided only modest=20
financing for research into clean energy technology.=20
The president appeared at a highly efficient heating and cooling plant near=
=20
St. Paul that burns a variety of fuels, including oil, coal and waste wood,=
=20
to sound a theme he plans to repeat day after day. The parties in the energ=
y=20
debate have ''yelled at each other enough,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Now it's time=
=20
to listen to each other.'' [Excerpts, Page A14.]=20
''Too often Americans are asked to take sides between energy production and=
=20
environmental protection,'' Mr. Bush added, before flying here, to a farmin=
g=20
town north of Des Moines, to continue his argument at a small biomass plant=
=20
that makes power by burning materials derived from animal waste and plants.=
=20
''As if people who revere the Alaskan wilderness do not also care about=20
America's energy future; as if the people who produce America's energy do n=
ot=20
care about the planet their children will inherit.''=20
Mr. Bush appeared to be weaving a careful political thread, arguing that if=
=20
America failed to act now, ''this great country could face a darker future,=
 a=20
future that is, unfortunately, being previewed in rising prices at the gas=
=20
pump and rolling blackouts in the great state of California.''=20
Mr. Bush also said rising energy prices had put an intolerable burden on=20
families and farmers. But some of the statistics in his own report seemed t=
o=20
undercut that claim. One chart showed that the share of disposable househol=
d=20
income spent on energy had declined to less than 5 percent today from 8=20
percent during the early days of the Reagan administration. (That percentag=
e=20
has begun to rise again, but only to the levels of the mid-1990's, before a=
=20
sharp drop in energy prices.)=20
Mr. Bush talked not only of blackouts but of blackmail, raising the specter=
=20
of a future in which the United States is increasingly vulnerable to foreig=
n=20
oil suppliers. He argued, for example, that the Arctic National Wildlife=20
Reserve, which he wants to open to drilling, can produce 600,000 barrels of=
=20
oil a day for the next 47 years. ''That happens to be exactly the amount th=
e=20
United States now imports from Iraq,'' he said.=20
Opening the Alaskan refuge to drilling is just one source of contention wit=
h=20
Democrats and some moderate Republicans, many of whom argue that the Bush=
=20
administration has put undue emphasis on increasing supplies of fossil fuel=
s=20
at the expense of the environment.=20
Critics say that although the report seems designed to suggest a balanced=
=20
approach, it minimizes the potential role of alternative sources of energy=
=20
and the possibility of reducing future demand through efficiency and=20
conservation.=20
''America must embrace the promise offered by new technologies,'' said=20
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut. ''The energy crisis i=
s=20
not an excuse for creating an environmental crisis.''=20
Republicans offered far more support for the president. Senator Frank H.=20
Murkowski of Alaska, chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, said he plann=
ed=20
hearings next week to begin consideration of 25 recommendations in the Bush=
=20
report that require legislative action.=20
''Not everyone is going to like this plan,'' Mr. Murkowski said, ''but at=
=20
least now we have a plan to kick around.''=20
He said the previous administration had failed to grapple with the nation's=
=20
energy sources through a comprehensive plan. Clinton administration officia=
ls=20
disputed the assertion and blamed Congress for failing to enact energy=20
legislation.=20
Yet even Mr. Murkowski sounded a note of caution about Mr. Bush's approach.=
=20
He said the report offered few immediate remedies for California's=20
electricity crisis or for rising gasoline prices. He said Republicans might=
=20
have to consider a gas-tax rollback or the temporary suspension of some=20
environmental provisions to address supply bottlenecks.=20
Mr. Bush was praised by many groups for laying out a long-term energy polic=
y.=20
His report contained 105 initiatives -- although many of them are=20
endorsements of actions already in place. And while in his public comments =
he=20
always started with talk of conservation, the report itself was much more=
=20
specific when it came to tapping new supplies.=20
''No matter how much we conserve, we're still going to need more energy,'' =
he=20
said here this afternoon. ''The State of California is the second best stat=
e=20
at conservation, and yet they are still running out of energy.''=20
Among those who took a different view was former president Jimmy Carter, wh=

Lodi just says no to powers that be: Four times since March, the city kept=

LODI -- In this old farm town, where ferment is largely confined to wine=20
bottles, leaders are staging a Boston Tea Party against California's energy=
=20
crisis.=20
Lodi, population 57,000, is refusing to participate in the rolling blackout=
s=20
that have swept across California. Four times since March, Lodi's electric=
=20
utility has snubbed the state's power managers and kept its lights on while=
=20
others went dark.=20
The rock band Creedence Clearwater Revival once derided Lodi as a=20
conservative backwater, but now, this town is leading an unlikely revolt th=
at=20
is being picked up by others statewide.=20
""Lodi has something of an independent streak,"" said Steve Mann, a former ci=
ty=20
councilman in Lodi and one of many residents who support the city's utility=
.=20
""It doesn't make sense that we should participate in blackouts when we have=
=20
done everything we can to make sure we can avoid that.""=20
So far, Lodi has the only utility in the state to openly defy an on-the-spo=
t=20
call for blackouts. They did so twice in March, then twice again this month=
.=20
This week, however, Riverside's utility said it, too, would not participate=
=20
in forced outages, and leaders of some other ""munis"" may follow suit.=20
Worried about a political snowball, Gov. Gray Davis met with leaders of the=
=20
munis last week, but refused to exempt them from further blackouts. If that=
=20
happened, the state's power managers would be unable to spread blackouts to=
=20
25 percent of the state's households, putting the brunt on other parts of t=
he=20
state.=20
""I'm sympathetic,"" said David Freeman, the governor's top energy adviser an=
d=20
a former leader of municipal utilities in Sacramento and Los Angeles. But=
=20
Freeman, speaking with uncharacteristic guardedness, said it may not be=20
practical ""to separate out utilities that are an integral part of the grid.=
""=20
The self-proclaimed ""wine grape capital of the world,"" Lodi would seem an=
=20
unlikely hotbed for dissent. Creedence Clearwater once bemoaned being ""stuc=
k=20
in Lodi."" Instead of being offended by the song, many residents are glad=20
their town isn't inhabited by a bunch of long-haired rabble-rousers.=20
Even so, Lodi likes to defy convention when it comes to protecting its own.=
=20
Two years ago, the city started waging battle against big insurance compani=
es=20
that didn't want to pay to clean up toxic substances from local businesses=
=20
that had trickled into water supplies.=20
In recent years, Lodi has spent millions sprucing up its once-dilapidated=
=20
downtown, which soon will be crowned by a new 12-screen cineplex.=20
But the town's biggest source of pride is its taxpayer-owned utility, which=
=20
started in the 1890s when two brothers, Ed and Fred Carey, launched a water=
=20
and electric utility. In 1910, they sold it to the city of Lodi for $35,000=
.=20
Now, the utility provides $4 million to the town's coffers every year, with=
 a=20
$30 million annual budget.=20
Like many other municipal utilities in Northern California, Lodi has more=
=20
power lined up than it needs, but is dependent on Pacific Gas and Electric=
=20
Co. to deliver that power to its doorstep.=20
As a result, ""Lodi's relationship with PG&E has been tenuous throughout its=
=20
history,"" said Mann. One point of contention is the interconnection agreeme=
nt=20
among PG&E, Lodi and the town's fellow members in the Northern California=
=20
Power Agency.=20
PG&E officials say the agreement requires Lodi to shed power during any pow=
er=20
shortfall. But Lodi contends the pact obligates the utility to impose=20
blackouts only during ""physical emergencies,"" such as a wind storm that=20
knocks out transformers.=20
""We don't see any compelling reason why Lodi should have to participate in=
=20
rolling blackouts,"" said Alan Vallow, director of the city's utility. ""You=
=20
want me to turn customers off when we have the capacity to keep them on? Th=
at=20
doesn't work for me.""=20
During a statewide call for blackouts, PG&E conceivably could just switch o=
ff=20
power for Lodi if the city's utility didn't heed the call voluntarily. But=
=20
Vallow doubts PG&E would take such a step. ""That would be pretty extreme,"" =
he=20
said.=20
An engineer who used to work for Los Angeles' utility, Vallow has become=20
""something of a folk hero"" because of his stance, said Mann. Vallow is=20
especially popular with Lodi's canneries, which need reliable power in the=
=20
summer to pack fruit before it rots in the field. And most Lodites ""are 100=
=20
percent behind Mr. Vallow,"" said Marie Saunders, a longtime local resident.=
=20
On the other hand, Lodi's City Council hasn't officially endorsed Vallow's=
=20
decision, giving it an out should PG&E or state officials seek revenge.=20
""If we weren't supportive, we would let Alan know,"" said Alan Nakanishi, th=
e=20
mayor of Lodi. ""On the other hand, if we do get retribution, we may say to=
=20
Al, 'Hey, what is all this about?' ""=20
So far, PG&E hasn't threatened any action against Lodi, but experts say the=
=20
town is venturing into murky legal territory.=20
""It is a legal question that hasn't been resolved,"" said John Fistolera,=20
legislative director of the Northern California Power Agency, a group of=20
municipal utilities that includes Lodi.=20
The Sacramento Municipal Utility District, which is not part of NCPA, also=
=20
has taken a cautious approach. Earlier this year, at least one SMUD board=
=20
member recommended the utility follow Lodi's example. But the idea was=20
dropped amid fears that SMUD, being a bigger utility, could face a legal=20
fight that PG&E wouldn't mount against little Lodi.=20
""I really admire what Lodi has done,"" said Linda Davis, a SMUD board member=
.=20
""But I don't want to end up in court, and I fear SMUD would end up in court=
.""=20
Instead of an open rebellion, SMUD has joined the Southern California town =
of=20
Vernon and 13 other cities in appealing to the Federal Energy Regulatory=20
Commission. They want FERC to exempt them from blackouts ordered by the=20
state's grid manager, the Independent System Operator.=20
ISO officials argue that ""load shedding"" from the municipal utilities is=20
vital for maintaining balance on the grid during shortfalls. But SMUD and t=
he=20
other municipalities say they shouldn't be penalized for lining up power=20
reserves that have eluded the state's big utilities, especially with the=20
state facing dozens of blackouts this summer.=20
""Like Vernon, SMUD has grave concerns over the prospect of sharply escalati=
ng=20
the number and duration of blackout occurrences directed by the ISO on a=20
grid-wise basis over the upcoming summer months,"" SMUD wrote to FERC.=20
Last week, the Riverside City Council voted to stop participating in=20
blackouts ordered by the ISO. Like Lodi, Riverside says its conservation=20
programs should be taken into account in ISO's attempts to deal with power=
=20
shortages.=20
Vallow says Lodi has done everything it can to help the state. In January,=
=20
the city complied with blackout orders, then purchased long-term contracts=
=20
that gave it a 40 percent surplus in power reserves.=20
To pay for those reserves, the utility increased customer rates by as much =
as=20
15 percent.=20
Since then, the city has sold excess power back to the state to help with=
=20
shortages. But Vallow also has told the state that Lodi will not participat=
e=20
in further blackouts.=20
Vallow calls it the ""SET"" program, which stands for ""System, Electric suppl=
y=20
and Team.""=20
""We've done everything the state should have done to avoid the crisis we ar=
e=20

WASHINGTON -- When President Bush and Gov. Gray Davis meet this week to=20

s=20
that until now have been playing out long distance.=20
To Californians struggling with rolling blackouts and skyrocketing power=20

electricity price controls can seem baffling -- if not payback for the=20
state's vote against him in the presidential election.=20
Yet a look at the record shows that Bush and his energy czar, Vice Presiden=
t=20
Dick Cheney, share an unshakable faith in open power markets shaped by=20
conservative politics and their long association with an industry that has=

It is a view fortified by energy company executives who enjoy easy access t=
o=20
top administration officials and counsel against measures like price=20

wield great influence with the White House on energy policy.=20
Davis argues that because the deregulation plan adopted by the state in 199=

marketers and generators now have enough leverage to charge, on average, mo=

Temporary Western price controls -- based on the cost of producing the powe=

""It would be a grave mistake for the Bush administration to allow rigid=20

e=20
consumption.=20
""The president and this administration do not support price caps because th=
ey=20

The folly of price controls is an article of faith in the oil industry, whi=

was long subjected to them. Both Bush and Cheney prospered in that industry=
.=20
Bush founded an oil company in his native West Texas in 1977, shortly after=
=20
graduating from business school. Arbusto Energy didn't find much oil, but=

Before Bush plucked him out of the private sector, Cheney headed Halliburto=

""I think there's no doubt that their views have been shaped by their=20
backgrounds in the industry and their broader ideological views about=20
markets,"" said political analyst Stuart Rothenberg.=20
Cheney in particular has expressed a visceral aversion to price controls. H=

""The night the control regulations went to the Federal Register to be=20

Davis, by contrast, was invited to simply submit a one-page memo to the=20

Republicans also opposed the Democrats' plan to replenish the state treasur=

that would be repaid by ratepayers. They claimed that the bond was so large=

?????The hotel--which no longer offers lodging, just food and drink, and=20
plenty of it--is bustling these days with the roustabout energy of a Lone=
=20
Star construction camp. Just down the road, a mammoth electrical power plan=
t=20
is rising out of the sagebrush, its generators housed in four boxy building=
s=20
the size of airplane hangars.
?????It is one of six new major gas-fired power plants expected to be built=
=20
in Kern County over the next several years, an electrical construction boom=
=20
unmatched anywhere in California. Kern, which already has a large surplus o=
f=20
electricity, is cementing its place as California's energy capital, assumin=
g=20
far more than its share of the burden in recharging the state's drained pow=
er=20
supplies.
?????Over the next several years, the county will add nearly 5,000 megawatt=
s=20
of power to the statewide grid. That is more than California now imports, o=
n=20
average, from out-of-state suppliers. It's enough to supply about five=20
counties the size of Kern, which fills the dusty southern rim of the San=20
Joaquin Valley and has a population of 662,000.
?????In some parts of the state, a proposal to build a new power plant is a=
=20
call to throw up the barricades. In recent months, intense community=20
opposition has forced developers to pull back proposals to build major plan=
ts=20
in South Gate and San Jose, although Gov. Gray Davis has tried to revive=20
plans for the San Jose plant.
?????You don't hear a lot of not-in-my-backyard talk in Kern County.
?????""There should be power plants in everybody's backyard,"" said Paul Gipe=
,=20
chairman of the Kern chapter of the Sierra Club, which did not oppose any o=
f=20
the new plants. ""If people are concerned about having too many power plants=
,=20
they should think twice when they flip on the light switch.""
?????New, natural gas-fired power plants, Gipe reasoned, are relatively cle=
an=20
and will not add significantly to the county's serious air pollution=20
problems. Ideally, he said, they will allow the state to close some older,=
=20
dirtier plants that cause considerably more environmental damage.
?????If environmentalists don't oppose the plants, it's not too much of a=
=20
leap to guess that some people might be positively thrilled about them.
?????Just try, for instance, asking somebody in Taft, an oil center south o=
f=20
McKittrick. ""It's more money coming into Kern County--that's the way I look=
=20
at it,"" said Pamela Dunlap, who runs a downtown thrift shop.

?????An Economy Rooted in the Oil Industry
?????She stood in the twilight outside her shop, on a street that embodies=
=20
many of the most attractive attributes of small town Americana--with one=20
small difference. Where some towns might have statues of their founders or=
=20
war heroes in prominent public places, Taft has erected small oil rigs and=
=20
other pieces of drilling machinery, a reminder of its economic roots.
?????That Kern County has stepped up as California's blackout-buster is,=20
perhaps, not surprising.
?????To begin with, there's geography. Kern stands astride California's maj=
or=20
north-south electrical transmission lines at precisely the spot at which th=

Northern California, and Southern California Edison. That spot can be=20
pinpointed as the Midway substation, a vast jungle of humming wires,=20
transformers and circuit breakers that lies a short distance west of=20
Interstate 5 in the town of Buttonwillow.
?????Already, massive new circuit-breakers--they look like Frankenstein=20
helmets sprouting 5-foot-long sparkplugs--are being erected at Midway to=20
handle the power from two major plants that will be revving up in the comin=
g=20
months: PG&E National Energy's La Paloma plant, the one near McKittrick; an=
d=20
Edison Mission Energy's Sunrise plant, just south of Taft.
?????The county is served by two major natural gas pipelines, which will be=
=20
tapped to run the plants. In fact, Kern contains the state's largest known=
=20
reservoirs of natural gas.
?????Another of Kern's geographic advantages?
?????""You look around, and you'll see there aren't a lot of people living=
=20
around here,"" observed Stephen Whaley, who is overseeing construction of th=
e=20
Sunrise plant. In the surrounding hills, an orchard of oil rigs bobbed in t=
he=20
morning haze. Dirt roads cut crudely across the landscape, bisecting a=20
crisscross of steam pipes, fuel lines and electrical wires.
?????""This area is all about oil,"" Whaley said. Casting a glance at the=20
modular 560-megawatt plant rising behind him, he added with a wry smile, ""Y=
ou=20
know, I guess you could look at this from the road, and you could make the=
=20
argument that it improves the looks.""
?????The Sunrise plant, a relatively simple single-cycle plant, is expected=
=20
to fire up 320 megawatts of its total output by Aug. 1, a scant nine months=
=20
after construction began. The other plants--more complex and efficient=20
dual-cycle operations--will be opening over the next several years, assumin=
g=20
all receive final approval.
?????The lack of major opposition to the plants is, of course, another reas=
on=20
developers see Kern County as a good place to build. The county has long ha=
d=20
a more intimate relationship with energy--oil, gas, electricity--than most=
=20
places. To people here, the link between a natural gas well and a lightbulb=
,=20
or an oil derrick and a gas pedal, is neither theoretical nor especially=20
threatening. They're comfortable with energy.
?????Kern produces more crude oil than any other county in the United State=
s=20
outside Alaska. Property taxes from oil companies have helped build handsom=
e=20
new schools in Bakersfield, the county seat and largest city. The companies=

big payrolls have helped populate elegant subdivisions with names that soun=

Bakersfield restaurants are filled with references to trips to Texas, of=20
colleagues in Midland and Odessa. A Bakersfield radio station was running a=

in=20
Houston.
?????Until December 1999, American Airlines offered direct jet service=20
between Bakersfield and Dallas. It stopped after Occidental Petroleum moved=
=20
its headquarters from Bakersfield to Houston.
?????This is a county where President Bush received more support in the=20
November election than he did in Texas, his home state. But then, Bush=20
already had a Bakersfield connection: He lived there briefly as a child whe=

?????A lot of people in Kern County will tell you they don't mind being an=

?????Since January, California has authorized more than $7 billion in=20

?????Lawmakers are wary of making an even greater blunder than they did in=

WASHINGTON OUTLOOK
Bush Could Boost Green Power With Buying Power=20


By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer=20

?????Today, the south wall of the Energy Department's fortress-like=20
Washington headquarters is a fitting symbol for an agency that itself has=
=20
never quite established an identity: a 32,100-square-foot blank slab of=20
concrete.
?????Shortly before leaving office, however, the Clinton administration=20
awarded a Chicago architectural firm a contract to explore converting the=
=20
wall into something quite different: a vast solar array that would provide=
=20
much of the building's heat and power.
?????The firm--Solomon Cordwell Buenz & Associates--has produced a=20
spectacular design of a graceful, canopy-like Sun Wall that utilizes both=
=20
photovoltaic panels and hydronic systems, a liquid-filled vacuum tube that=
=20
warms with the sun's rays and can heat the building in winter. Now the firm=
=20
is working to estimate the cost of constructing its creation. ""We think it=
=20
would certainly draw attention to this whole new type of energy,"" says Mart=
in=20
Wolf, one of the designers. ""Which would be quite timely given where we are=
=20
as a nation.""
?????The Sun Wall stands as a riveting symbol of Washington's potential to=
=20
advance the development of renewable energy through a tool that's received=
=20
almost no attention in the energy debate: the purchasing power of the feder=
al=20
government itself. Through all its departments and agencies, the federal=20
government spends about $8 billion a year on energy--probably more than any=
=20
other single consumer in the world. That buying power gives the government=
=20
enormous leverage to speed the growth of renewable energy sources such as=
=20
solar, wind, geothermal and biomass.
?????Today, all of these renewable sources (leaving aside hydropower) provi=
de=20
only 2% to 3% of the nation's electricity, mostly because they are too=20
expensive to compete with conventional sources. Renewables are in the same=
=20
Catch-22 as many new technologies: Because they are too expensive, they=20
cannot attract the sales that their makers need to both generate economies =
of=20
scale and invest in more advanced manufacturing techniques.
?????Government can break the logjam by providing a market that allows=20
renewable manufacturers to advance up the learning curve and lower the pric=
e=20
of their technologies to a level that makes them commercially competitive.
?????Washington has done precisely this before, most important with a produ=
ct=20
that has literally transformed modern life: the microchip at the heart of t=
he=20
computer revolution. The first microchips were much too expensive to attrac=
t=20
commercial customers, but in the early 1960s, both NASA (using the chips fo=
r=20
the Apollo space program) and the Defense Department (embedding the chips i=
n=20
nuclear weapons) provided a guaranteed market--buying the chips without=20
regard to cost.
?????As author T.R. Reid recounted in ""The Chip,"" his history of the=20
microchip: ""The government's willingness to buy chips in quantity at premiu=
m=20
prices provided the money the semiconductor firms needed to hone their skil=
ls=20
in designing and producing [the] circuits. . . . As experience taught ways =
to=20
solve the most common production problems, the cost of making a chip began =
to=20
fall.""
?????Three years after the government first started buying, the cost fell f=
ar=20
enough that the microchip attracted its first commercial customers. Its bee=
n=20
a breakneck race to the future ever since.
?????An alliance of centrist House Democrats has sensibly proposed that=20
Washington do the same for renewables. Earlier this month, the House New=20
Democrat Coalition introduced legislation that would commit the federal=20
government to purchasing a fixed percentage of its power from renewable=20
sources; the bill also would provide grants and loans to encourage state=20
governments and nonprofit organizations to also buy green. ""Today, you can'=
t=20
generate the revenue to make these technologies more commercially viable,""=
=20
says Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.), one of the bill's principal authors. ""The w=
ay=20
to get around that is to use the market power of the federal government to=
=20
help create a market.""
?????With little attention, former President Clinton already committed the=
=20
federal government to that course. In 1999, he signed an executive order=20
mandating that Washington expand its use of renewable energy; later, his=20
administration set a goal of obtaining 2.5% of its electricity from renewab=
le=20
sources by 2005, almost eight times more than today. Smith believes that go=
al=20
is already too low, largely because renewables are becoming more competitiv=
e=20
as conventional sources grow more expensive.
?????Even so, this initiative is already spurring new thinking. As part of=
=20
the overall plan, the Clinton administration committed to installing 20,000=
=20
solar systems on government facilities by 2010; by the time he left office,=
=20
2,000 were already in place.
?????""It's out in the national parks, where instead of having to string pow=
er=20
lines to remote buildings, they are putting up solar systems,"" says Dan=20
Reicher, the assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy=
=20
under Clinton. ""There are several thousand units of naval housing in Hawaii=
=20
that are now using solar. They are being used at the Coast Guard Station in=
=20
Boston, a post office in Nantucket.""
?????Another dramatic project is underway in Nevada. Shortly before Clinton=
=20
left office, his administration signed an agreement with a private consorti=
um=20
to lease part of an old nuclear test site in the desert northwest of Las=20
Vegas as a giant wind power facility that would be the nation's second=20
largest. Eventually the site is expected to provide power for California an=
d=20
Nevada and the Energy Department itself from 500 wind turbines.
?????President Bush hasn't tipped his hand entirely on leveraging governmen=
t=20
buying power to boost renewables. Disturbingly, the national energy plan th=
at=20
Bush released earlier this month says not a word about the use of governmen=
t=20
procurement. But Jill Schroeder, an Energy Department spokeswoman, says the=
=20
administration has indicated no intention to revoke the Clinton executive=
=20
order--and the green power purchasing goal it includes.
?????As for the Sun Wall, Energy Department officials sound dubious--but th=
ey=20
are reserving judgment until Wolf's firm completes its cost estimates. The=
=20
cost could indeed be intimidating; even the Clinton team hadn't committed=
=20
itself to construction. But such a strategic purchase can pay dividends for=

Suddenly, Dirty Old Coal Is the Fossil Fuel of the Future=20
Energy: The power crisis--and Bush's plan to deal with it--has lifted the=
=20
mining lobby and the industry it promotes.=20

By GERALDINE BAUM, Times Staff Writer

?????WASHINGTON--The National Mining Assn. represents a fuel that many=20
Americans think went out with Charles Dickens.
?????Just last week, a California congressman's aide asked an association=
=20
lobbyist wide-eyed: ""Do we still use coal in this country?""
?????The answer is yes--and lots of it. More than half of America's=20
electricity is coal-fired, but polls show that most Americans don't know it=
.
?????Considered the voice of coal in Washington, the mining association has=
=20
been denigrated by critics as a venal hired gun for an industry that doesn'=
t=20
give a whit about acid rain, global warming, black lung disease or slag hea=
ps=20
that scar the land. The industry was under siege in the final years of the=
=20
Clinton administration, when Washington launched an aggressive effort to ma=
ke=20
owners of coal-fired power plants undertake expensive pollution control=20
improvements.
?????""It was like waking up every morning with a six-chamber gun pointed at=
=20
your head, and each chamber contained a lethal bullet,"" said Thomas Altmeye=
r,=20
the association's top lobbyist.
?????Suddenly, it's a new day for coal in America. That much became clear t=
o=20
Altmeyer the other day as he found himself at the White House, where Vice=
=20
President Dick Cheney personally briefed about 40 industry types on the Bus=
h=20
administration's new energy plan.
?????""It was really nice to hear it from him,"" says Altmeyer.=20
?????A lot has changed in the short time since George W. Bush beat Al Gore =
in=20
West Virginia (and lots of other places), and California's power crisis=20
transformed dirty old coal into a fossil fuel of the future.
?????Now, when the mining association faxes position papers to the U.S.=20
Environmental Protection Agency, they are read. Now, when its lobbyists cal=
l=20
over to the U.S. Interior Department with suggestions for job candidates,=
=20
they talk with old friends occupying key positions. Now, those at the top=
=20
don't need to be told that coal supplies more than half of America's=20
electricity: Bush comes from Texas, which uses more coal-fired power than a=
ny=20
other state in the union; Cheney hails from Wyoming, the largest=20
coal-producing state.
?????When the Bush-Cheney team took over, mining association employees were=
=20
invited to serve on transition teams. The White House had not had a new=20
occupant but two months before Bush reversed himself on carbon dioxide=20
emissions, deciding to forgo new rules on a gas that scientists say=20
contributes to global warming. Coal-fired power plants are a key source of=
=20
the gas.=20
?????Yet, like poor relatives who have finally been invited over for=20
Christmas dinner, the coal people are not quite comfortable with their=20
newfound popularity in Washington. When asked how it feels to go from class=
=20
pariah to homecoming king, the best that Altmeyer and his boss, mining=20
association President Jack Gerard, can come up with is that they're, well .=
 .=20
. pleased.
?????But their friends know better: The chief of staff to a Southern=20
Republican senator said he saw the usually low-key, all-business Altmeyer a=
t=20
an inaugural party in January. ""He was downright elated,"" said the aide,=20
chuckling.
?????A coal-friendly Democratic senator slapped Altmeyer on the back at a=
=20
fund-raiser recently and said, ""Tom, I can't believe it, but we really have=
=20
an opportunity to do something. All the liberal senators are running scared=
=20
about this California energy crisis. Now they'll listen to us."" The next da=
y,=20
Altmeyer shipped him a list of suggestions to share with his liberal=20
colleagues.
?????""We're not going to waste this opportunity to educate people, no way,""=
=20
says Altmeyer.=20
?????The association's president, Gerard, 42, a native of Idaho and a forme=
r=20
consultant to the mining industry, is not ready to celebrate. He is new at=
=20
his job: He took over the NMA shortly before Bush took over the White House=
,=20
but he has been around mining long enough to remember other times when the=
=20
industry was left for dead but rebounded with an energy crisis.
?????And so, he says, he is merely ""cautiously optimistic.""
?????""You might sense some excitement in the industry,"" he allows, ""that we=
=20
have a White House that recognizes the facts."" He then rattles off a bunch:=
=20
The U.S. has enough reserves in the ground to burn coal at its current rate=
=20
for 250 years; since implementation of the 1970 Clean Air Act, coal use for=
=20
electricity has tripled while emissions have dropped 30%.
?????""We play an important role in society and the White House knows it,""=
=20
Gerard says. ""Does that make us gleeful? Not necessarily.""
?????Perhaps it's because coal is still a hard sell to many people.=20
?????Gerard is the speaker at a conference of 400 scientists interested in=
=20
""carbon sequestration,"" a theoretical solution to coal's contribution to=20
global warming. But he spends about half of his time attacking=20
environmentalists and saying things like, ""California represents a failed=
=20
experiment in energy policy.""
?????When a professor takes issue with his combative ""tone,"" Gerard smiles=
=20
pleasantly. He is not fazed. On the cab ride back to his office, he explain=
s,=20
""Look, the professor is looking for a technical paper. That's not what we d=
o.=20
I'm trying to talk about what is at stake and the future.""
?????In recent years, the NMA has tried to refashion its industry's dark=20
legacy and image. It spent less time calling scientific evidence against co=
al=20
""bunk"" and more time on the bandwagon to clean up three of the four main=20
pollutants caused by its use. And now coal-related businesses are trying to=
=20
act like winners. Besides backing Bush's $2-billion plan for more ""clean=20
coal"" technology, they're spending $10 million of their own money on a=20
campaign to buff up their image.=20
?????More than image-building, however, the real work of the mining=20
association these days is in the massive Capitol building and House and=20
Senate offices. There is where the administration's energy plan will be=20
fashioned into action; there is where the president's budget will buy the=
=20
coal industry time to develop new anti-pollution technology; there is where=
=20
they can get government to ease up.
?????Altmeyer is a tall, strapping fellow. But, although he was born in Wes=
t=20
Virginia, he wasn't born to its coal. His father was an undertaker.
?????After earning degrees in law and business, Altmeyer went to work for t=
he=20
late Democratic Sen. Jennings Randolph of West Virginia, and he got to know=
=20
""lots of coal miners who were proud of what they're doing,"" he says.=20
?????In the mid-1980s, he went with a trade association that evolved into t=
he=20
NMA. He has spent most of his career shepherding companies through=20
anti-pollution legislation.
?????He can't quite abide the way coal is treated like a ""black hat"" in the=
=20
media--even now. ""You don't see banner headlines, 'U.S. has record coal=20
production in the year 2000, and we did it in a way much more environmental=

?????Instead, he says, media reports emphasize renegade coal companies that=

El Paso CEO Admits Approving Subsidiaries' Natural Gas Deal=20

?????WASHINGTON--The chief executive of a Texas energy company testified=20
Friday that he approved a controversial deal between two subsidiaries that=

?????""What I don't do is micromanage,"" Wise said under questioning by Judge=

Police Support 48-Hour Alerts for Blackouts=20
Crisis: Law enforcement officials downplay crime fears, saying notice of=20
power outages will make their jobs easier.=20

By MITCHELL LANDSBERG, Times Staff Writer


?????Earlier this year, when widespread blackouts first began to roll their=
=20
way across California, electric utility officials explained why they couldn=
't=20
give the public more than a few minutes' warning before pulling the plug.
?????Advance notice, they explained, would give the upper hand to criminals=
,=20
who could plan their day around out-of-service burglar alarms.
?????That was then.
?????This is now: On Friday, law enforcement officials throughout Southern=
=20
California hailed a decision by Gov. Gray Davis to create an early-warning=
=20
system that would give the public increasingly specific alerts during the 4=
8=20
hours leading up to a blackout.
?????""It's a huge improvement,"" Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca said at=
 a=20
news conference, where he was joined by senior officials of the California=

Highway Patrol and the Los Angeles Police Department, among other agencies.=
=20
The governor announced his plan Thursday.
?????The governor's plan was also endorsed by 35 police chiefs from=20
throughout Los Angeles County. The chiefs held their annual meeting Friday =
in=20
Palm Springs.
?????Since the blackouts began, ""one of the No. 1 issues has been the lack =
of=20
notification,"" said Pasadena Police Chief Bernard Melekian, who is presiden=
t=20
of the county police chiefs association.
?????What gives? What has changed since January, when officials from Southe=
rn=20
California Edison insisted that they couldn't give more than five or 10=20
minutes' warning?
?????Richard Rosenblum, a senior vice president for Edison, said the utilit=
y=20
had canvassed law enforcement officials earlier this year. ""The general vie=
w=20
at that time--and it certainly was not unanimous--was that for public safet=

reasons, it would be better not to release that information.""
?????Since then, he said, ""there's been a good deal more thinking . . . and=

that view has changed.""
?????Melekian (whose city is served by its own utility, not Edison) said he=

heard that explanation before.
?????""I remember, when they were saying that, I had trouble finding anybody=

?????Were police worried about looting and burglaries in a blackout?
?????""We never were worried about that,"" Melekian said. With blackouts=20

?????Baca said he did have concerns, but they were erased Monday, when Davi=

?????""All of us were extremely relieved that . . . our fears about crime=20

""Theft is a problem and that's just as costly.""
?????Glendale isn't alone--bright lights can be seen after midnight at car=

Venice, a lamp store in Studio City and a Goodyear Tires store in Westwood,=

where the manager said the lights stay on till 3 a.m.
?????""We are obligated to the corporate office to keep our lights on,"" said=

the tire store manager, who would not give his name. ""We do what they tell=

?????In San Francisco's Union Square, retailers and restaurants also keep=

then, police have expressed confusion about the 50% rule and whether cities=

?????Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy David Cervantes said his agency is=

?????Glendale Police spokesman Sgt. Rick Young said the late-night bright=

Businesses Hopeful on Blackout Warnings=20
Power: But some leaders worry that early outage notification won't be=20
accurate.=20

By MARLA DICKERSON, Times Staff Writer


?????Frustrated at being left in the dark about rolling blackouts, Californ=
ia=20
business leaders expressed optimism Friday that a proposed early warning=20
system will help minimize the economic damage of power outages on the state=
's=20
industries.
?????Gov. Gray Davis ordered state officials Thursday to begin warning=20
residents and businesses of likely power outages up to two days in advance=
=20
when power supplies appear scarce. Given the fluid nature of the state's=20
electricity grid, which can see its supplies swing from abundant to=20
inadequate in a matter of minutes, some of those predictions could prove=20
about as useful as a weather report six months in advance.
?????But business advocates say any information is better than no informati=
on=20
when it comes to avoiding outages.
?????""Businesspeople are accustomed to assessing risk,"" said Jack Stewart,=
=20
president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Assn. ""We need to=
=20
give them the best available information, as far ahead as possible, and let=
=20
them make their own decisions.""
?????Under Davis' order, blackouts will be issued under a three-tiered syst=
em=20
beginning with a forecast 48 hours in advance of a projected electricity=20
shortfall.
?????General geographic areas to be blacked out will be identified in=20
warnings issued 24 hours before likely outages. Precise locations will be=
=20
announced an hour before the power is cut.
?????Details are still being worked out, but the idea is to use data such a=
s=20
weather patterns and scheduled power plant shutdowns to make the longer-ran=
ge=20
projections. Information about communities and specific block numbers to be=
=20
interrupted will be provided closer to the projected outages, as real-time=
=20
usage and supply information becomes available to the grid operator.
?????Plans call for notifying electricity customers through a variety of=20
means, including the news media, the California Independent System Operator=
=20
(Cal-ISO), utility Web sites and a proactive system being developed by=20
Cal-ISO to phone, page, fax or e-mail individual power users. Agency=20
officials say they plan to implement the governor's order by June 15.
?????Business interests have been beating the drum for early warning since=
=20
the first rolling blackouts walloped companies last summer. Though resident=
s=20
might find it inconvenient to have their dishwashers turned off, a sudden=
=20
outage can wreak havoc on a company if an assembly line freezes or a comput=
er=20
system crashes.
?????The stakes are enormous. A Silicon Valley business group estimated tha=
t=20
a single blackout last June resulted in losses of $100 million for that=20
region's companies because of forfeited sales, squandered productivity,=20
wasted wages and ruined products.
?????A study released this month by a California business consortium=20
estimated that a projected 30-plus days of summer blackouts could cost stat=
e=20
businesses $21.8 billion, reduce household income by $4.5 billion and resul=
t=20
in 135,000 lost jobs.
?????Julie Puentes, a spokeswoman for the Orange County Business Council,=
=20
said the governor's plan is consistent with what businesses have been=20
demanding. ""If they can do this, companies will be able to use the backup=
=20
generation that they've paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for,"" she sai=
d.=20
""They will be able to prevent chaos for their workers, and they'll be able =
to=20
maintain their business operations, which benefits the California economy.""
?????The president of Aluminum Precision Products in Santa Ana, which has=
=20
four manufacturing plants in Orange County, was equally enthusiastic.
?????""You have no idea what help [the warnings] would be,"" Philip S. Keeler=
=20
said. ""In our particular case, because of the heavy equipment, this could b=
e=20
the difference between life and death, and I'm very serious. It will help=
=20
tremendously.""
?????Others are skeptical.
?????James Swartwout, chief executive of Torrance-based Summa Industries,=
=20
said he's not counting on the system to protect his molded plastics=20
manufacturing company.
?????""How can they say with certainty that a blackout will occur?"" Swartwou=
t=20
asked. ""It's my understanding that they have no real way of knowing until t=
he=20
very last minute. Eventually, we'll get two or three warnings a week. I can=
't=20
promise we won't start to ignore them.""
?????Indeed, while early warning sounds good in theory, implementing it is=
=20
another story. The utilities long resisted such a system because they often=
=20
get only a few minutes' notice from Cal-ISO, which in turn often isn't able=
=20
to project a shortfall with absolute certainty until it is almost upon them=
.
?????One of the big concerns with early warning is that it simply won't be=
=20
accurate. Cal-ISO board member Mike Florio, a consumer advocate, said he=20
worries about crying wolf.
?????""After the third or fourth or 10th time,"" Florio said, ""people start t=
o=20
say, 'They're always calling these things, and nothing ever happens.' ""
?????But board member Carl Guardino, who also is head of the Silicon Valley=
=20
Manufacturing Group, sees that as a strength rather than a weakness of the=
=20
program.
?????He said early warning will prompt businesses to redouble their=20
conservation efforts, which could help stave off many of the projected=20
blackouts.
?????""That's not crying wolf; that's popping the champagne,"" Guardino said.=

""Preventing blackouts from happening in the first place is precisely what w=

President Bush traveled across the country to deliver news Gov. Gray Davis=

President Bush wasn't on California soil for more than five minutes yesterd=
ay=20
when he was drawn into his first debate on the state's power crunch.=20
Rep. Brad Sherman, a Democrat from Thousand Oaks who met Air Force One on t=
he=20
tarmac at Los Angeles International Airport along with a group of high scho=
ol=20
students, wasted no time button-holing the president for what appeared to b=
e=20
an animated conversation.=20
""I brought up . . . the idea that after his meeting with our governor, I=20
hoped he would be in favor of wholesale regulation (of energy prices),""=20
Sherman said later. ""He disagreed with me.""=20
Sherman -- who two weeks ago suggested that the headline to the president's=
=20
national energy policy should be ""Bush to California: Drop Dead"" -- didn't=
=20
seem optimistic yesterday about Bush's 48-hour visit to the state. ""I think=
=20
that the president's policies show either a lack of understanding of what's=
=20
really going on in California, or a lack of concern,"" he said.=20
That vignette underscored some of the challenges facing Bush, who arrived i=
n=20
California as protesters geared up and Democratic Gov. Gray Davis prepared =
to=20
press him for federal action on the state's power troubles.=20
Besides Sherman, Bush was greeted by a crowd of cheering Republicans,=20
including Secretary of State Bill Jones and Los Angeles Mayor Richard=20
Riordan, the former a declared GOP candidate for governor in 2002, the latt=
er=20
a rumored one.=20
But today, Bush will sit down with the present governor, who lately has bee=
n=20
blistering in his criticism of the president.=20
""The last time I looked, California was still part of the United States of=
=20
America,"" Davis told reporters this weekend. ""We have contributed=20
disproportionately to the economic growth of this country. There's no reaso=
n=20
why a president should not respond to a legitimate request from the chief=
=20
executive of the largest state in the union.""=20
In his first visit to California since just before the election, Bush plans=
=20
to emphasize the energy crisis -- but will focus on it through the lens of=
=20
his own energy plan.=20
ENERGY SECRETARY ACTS
Just hours before the president landed, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham=20
ordered a speedup in planning to relieve a notoriously overloaded electrici=
ty=20
transmission line in California.=20
Abraham's holiday action was timed to provide a bit of positive news for Bu=
sh=20
to announce in California. He ordered the Western Area Power Administration=
,=20
a 15-state marketing arm of the Energy Department, to complete planning and=
=20
seek outside financing to reduce the transmission bottleneck on California'=
s=20
Path 15, which connects the northern and southern parts of the state.=20
This morning, Bush will visit the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton, near=
=20
San Diego, to underscore his conservation order for a 10 percent cut in=20
energy usage in federal buildings and military facilities.=20
In Los Angeles, he will deliver a wide-ranging talk before the World Affair=
s=20
Council and lead a discussion among business leaders about technological=20
advances in energy conservation.=20
Then, he will head to Fresno and Sequoia National Park to press his=20
initiative to improve national parks. Along the way, protesters have vowed =
to=20
provide a vocal commentary on Bush's energy and environmental policies.=20
But the real drama of the trip will no doubt be the sit-down between Bush a=
nd=20
Davis today. The governor pushed for a lengthy, open meeting with Bush that=
=20
would include testimony from officials and consumers affected by the energy=
=20
crisis. Bush's camp announced Friday the meeting would be 20 to 30 minutes =
--=20
in private.=20
Davis plans to outline steps the state has taken to alleviate the energy=20
crisis, and what it wants the federal government to do -- including=20
implementing price caps on the wholesale cost of energy, cost-based pricing=
,=20
and the possibility of ordering refunds.=20
DAVIS THREATENING SUIT
The governor has said he will consider suing the Federal Energy Regulatory=
=20
Commission -- the agency charged with overseeing energy prices -- if it doe=
s=20
not impose temporary price caps.=20
And the state Legislature has already filed a suit, saying the commission h=
as=20
failed to stop what it has determined are ""unjust and unreasonable prices.""=
=20
With California's energy woes worsening and a summer of rolling blackouts=
=20
predicted, the Bush-Davis session holds potentially deep political pitfalls=
=20
for both leaders, both of whom are suffering in state polls as a result of=
=20
their handling of the energy crisis.=20
Bush needs to demonstrate his concern for California, a state that gave a=
=20
12-point margin of victory to Al Gore in the presidential election.=20
But even as Bush adviser Karen Hughes told state reporters this week that t=
he=20
president had arrived to show he cares, Vice President Dick Cheney again=20
chastised state officials for delaying their response to the energy crisis=
=20
""because all of the action was potentially unpleasant.""=20
And Cheney signaled that the administration would resist long-term price=20
caps, saying, ""We think that's a mistake.""=20
Such talk drew fire from Davis' senior political adviser, Garry South, who=
=20
charged that Cheney's words demonstrated insensitivity to California's=20
troubles and only underscored the perception of an ""all-oil, all-the-time=
=20
ticket.""=20
Davis, whose campaign for re-election next year will depend on his handling=
=20
of the crisis, has stepped up his criticism of Bush and profit-hungry energ=
y=20
firms, particularly those from Texas, in recent weeks.=20
And yesterday, signaling no letup, Davis' supporters made an unusual holida=
y=20
conference call to again press his case for federal action. They argued tha=
t=20
without immediate intervention from the Bush administration, the economy of=
=20
California -- and potentially the entire nation -- was at risk.=20
'THIS ENORMOUS SHOCK'=20
""We have this enormous shock in prices that needs to be addressed and not=

=20
Blinder and others argue that short-term relief -- for about 6 to 12 months=
=20
-- is necessary while new power plants are being built.=20
""Most times and most places, I agree price caps are not the long-run=20
solution, but they can be part of a short-term solution,"" Blinder said.=20

THIS WEEK, President Bush is making his first visit to California at a time=
=20
when consumers have been socked with hefty electric rate increases, and $70=
=20
million is being drained from our state budget each day as we buy wholesale=
=20
energy at outrageous prices.=20
If Bush were serious about helping Californians, he would immediately tell=
=20
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, to do its job. FERC's legal=
=20
mandate is to ensure that wholesale electricity prices are ""just and=20
reasonable."" But current wholesale prices are not just and reasonable, and=
=20
they are completely divorced from costs.=20
FERC has been ideologically fixated on the free market while ignoring the=
=20
reality that companies controlling California's energy supply are=20
manipulating the market to make obscenely high profits at our expense.=20
During the past several months, the news media have unveiled how generators=
=20
are turning power plants on and off as often as several times an hour; taki=
ng=20
plants off line for ""unscheduled maintenance,"" and simply refusing to sell=
=20
California power. Investigators have determined that these energy companies=
=20
have deliberately gouged consumers to the tune of billions of dollars.=20
State Senate figures show that profits of these energy companies rose more=
=20
500 percent between 1999 and 2000.=20
If President Bush wanted FERC to control wholesale prices through a system =
of=20
cost-plus pricing, it would happen overnight.=20
When it comes to long-term solutions, Bush's energy policy dangerously=20
promotes a continued reliance on polluting fossil fuels and a resurgence of=

unsafe nuclear energy. Bush pays lip service to smart, sustainable solution=
s=20
such as solar, wind and other sources of renewable energy, and to energy=20
savings derived from conservation and improved efficiency.=20
Technologies proven to be dirty, dangerous and expensive will get the lion'=

If the Bush administration were to make sustainable energy sources a=20

coal and utility industry leaders, it is central to any forward-looking=20
energy strategy.=20
The sensible responses to the energy crisis are clear: Control prices now a=

Chief engineer David Omosheyin, eyeing The Chronicle's thermometer nervousl=

that it was actually hotter inside than out. Though that wouldn't be hard,=

considering it was in the low 60s outside. And the places measured happened=

to be courtrooms and tax offices, where the body heat from anxiety alone=20
could probably melt the paint some days.=20
San Franciscans, Omosheyin said, are losing their perspective when it comes=

""The president did not create this problem, but he is uniquely situated to=

While this will not help this summer, Abraham said in a statement the line=

Vice President Dick Cheney fares better, with 47 percent of Californians=20

DAVIS' SHARP DECLINE
The Field Poll reported last week that as the energy crisis has ramped up,=
=20
the governor's overall approval ratings have fallen statewide. Today, 49=20
percent disapprove of his job performance and 42 percent approve -- a sharp=
=20

But the new poll shows that the public's views of the Legislature has dropp=

Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham unveiled plans to boost extra transmission=

Abraham ordered the Western Area Power Administration -- an Energy Departme=

Davis will ask Bush to impose wholesale electricity price controls and orde=
r=20
refunds for overcharged consumers, aides said, but the White House on Monda=
y=20
reiterated Bush's position that such steps would be counterproductive.=20
Davis spokesman Steven Maviglio said the steps announced by Abraham were no=
t=20
new and were not the kind of help California needed to meet its immediate=
=20
crisis. ``That's been kicked around for a while,'' he said.=20
Davis said last week he was prepared to ``go to court'' if Bush failed to=
=20
act. ``The law says we're entitled to relief and it hasn't been coming,''=
=20
Davis said.=20
White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan said that while Bush had ``worked ver=
y=20
hard'' to help California, through measures such as ordering the Defense=20
Department to reduce its energy use by 10 percent in California and easing=
=20
rules for using backup power generators, price controls ``make the problem=

er=20
lines with insufficient capacity to carry the necessary load between southe=
rn=20
California and the northern part of the state, especially during peak hours=
.=20
Abraham told WAPA to determine whether outsiders were interested in financi=
ng=20
and co-owning a new transmission line. ''The level of interest will be a=20
factor in the decision to build the line later this year,'' the Energy=20
Department said in a statement.=20
The statement did not make clear whether the federal government would go=20
ahead with the project in the absence of outside financing, nor did it give=
=20
cost details.=20
It said WAPA, which manages nearly 17,000 miles of transmission lines, woul=
d=20
prepare the necessary environmental and feasibility studies and review=20
easement and land acquisition issues.=20
LEADERSHIP ROLE=20
``The Bush administration is taking a leadership role in addressing a=20
long-neglected problem in California's electricity transmission system,''=
=20
Abraham said. ``California's electricity problems developed over a period o=
f=20

=20
that will help avert the same types of problems from recurring year after=

``Removing the so-called Path 15 bottleneck is a big step in the right=20
direction,'' he said.=20

California should try true deregulation=20
Moving toward a government monopoly is the wrong prescription




EDWARD R. MULLER=20
Mr. Muller is the former president and CEO of Edison Mission Energy, a=20
power-producing firm owned by Edison International and headquartered in=20
Irvine. This was co-authored by S. Linn Williams, former senior vice=20
president of Edison Mission Energy.=20

Capitalism won the Cold War because of better economics: Consumers make=20
better decisions than politicians, central planners or monopolists. That=20
lesson seems to have been learned better by those who lost the war than by=
=20
those who won it.
The failure to absorb the lesson is nowhere clearer than in the efforts to=
=20
deregulate utilities. Deregulation, we are being told, has failed. The ligh=
ts=20
are going out in California, and now politicians, governments, consumer=20
groups and the utilities themselves are rushing to hang out signs that read=
=20
""Capitalism doesn't work here.""=20
Principles matter, so let's start with some: The objective of government is=
=20
to provide a framework for a better life for its people, and monopolies are=
 a=20
bad framework. They are inefficient, and when they include the government,=
=20
whether as owner or comprehensive regulator, they are both inefficient and=
=20
dogmatic because politics enters the equation. We pay for that inefficiency=
=20
through higher taxes or higher prices.
We must, of course, keep the lights on to maintain our standard of living.=
=20
Does that mean that we just have to put up with the inefficiencies of=20
government-supported monopolies as a necessary evil to assure that importan=
t=20
services are available? We do not. The problem has not been too little=20
regulation, but too much. California is an excellent example.=20
What has gone wrong? The finger pointing has been great sport, but the core=
=20
of the problem is just the law of supply and demand. California flat ran=20
short of power. Many have wanted to build new power plants in California, b=
ut=20
the regulatory hurdles have been insurmountable. In recent times, the=20
utilities themselves said that California didn't need more power plants and=
=20
fought to stop the construction of new plants by others. The marketplace=20
didn't fail; regulation failed.=20
And California's vaunted ""deregulation"" was in reality just a botched=20
substitution of one form of regulation for another. When you deregulate a=
=20
monopoly marketplace, you want all buyers and sellers to be subject to mark=
et=20
forces. What California called ""deregulation"" didn't come close. First, the=
=20
state and the utilities agreed on fixed retail prices for five years.
As a result, consumers used electricity without knowing what it really cost=
=20
to produce. Second, the state and the utilities agreed that the utilities=
=20
would buy wholesale power through a system subject to market forces. As a=
=20
result, the cost of power bought by the utilities fluctuated even though th=
e=20
price they could charge was fixed.
The utilities thought the retail prices were fixed high enough to more than=
=20
cover what they expected power to cost them. For two years they were correc=
t=20
and bought power for much less than the fixed prices they charged their=20
customers, but last year the cost of power soared way above the fixed price=
s.=20
This wasn't deregulation, just another form of regulation. There were no=20
principles, just political expediency.=20
It didn't take long for economic reality to assert itself and the jury-rigg=
ed=20
structure came tumbling down. Blackouts, high prices and insolvent utilitie=
s=20
are not a failure of the marketplace; the marketplace never got a chance. N=
ow=20
we are at a fork in the road. Should we go back to the regulation of the pa=
st=20
or forward to full deregulation?=20
It's not fair to say that deregulation has failed. After all, we haven't=20
tried it yet. We should return to first principles: Deregulate properly by=
=20
making all aspects of the system subject to market forces. True deregulatio=
n=20
would include:=20
* Reducing the regulatory burdens on building new power plants.
* Eliminating fixed prices.=20
* Making sure that there are enough players in the market to make it=20
competitive.=20
* Having shareholders, not customers, be responsible for the financial=20
effects of business decisions.=20
Prices will vary with supply and demand and may rise at the outset until=20
supply is added, but over time a deregulated market will give customers the=
=20
lowest prices. The talk of a retreat to the regulation of the past is in pa=
rt=20
a result of our failure to articulate why capitalism won the Cold War and=
=20
competition makes the world a better place.=20
The tendencies of politicians to intervene, and of businessmen to ask=20
government to exempt their particular business from the marketplace, or som=
e=20
of its effects, remain strong. Ironically, prosperous times reinforce those=
=20
tendencies by masking their effects on the rest of us. Whether in good time=
s=20
or in bad, the public interest is a David to the Goliath of politicians,=20
bureaucrats and businessmen who see governmental protection as safer for=20
themselves than the hurly burly of competition.
Capitalism, like democracy, is imperfect, but both are far preferable to th=
e=20
alternatives. Our laws and regulations should provide the structure for a=

Power generators and traders are finally realizing that the phrase ""build i=

You can build all the new capacity you want=01*but if you don't have the na=

With roughly 90% of the 155,000 MW to 200,000 MW of announced capacity to=

=20
are beginning to add two and two together and really getting four.=20

Back to the future with a twist
Translation: The really smart power producers/traders are now locking in=20

For some players, it's back to the future, a return to the days when the sa=
me=20
company owned the fuel, the generation, and the transmission=01*but with a =
21st=20

""What goes around comes around in this business,"" said Edward Tirello Jr.,=
=20
managing director and senior power strategist-investment banking at Deutsch=
e=20
Banc Alex. Brown. ""The utilities used to own the various fuel sources, coal=
,=20
natural gas, and now they are getting back into it.""=20

""Oil and natural gas firms are rebundling, reintegrating, but in an=20
unregulated sense,"" said John Olson, an energy analyst in Houston with=20
Sanders Morris Harris.=20

Can't burn paper in a turbine
With volatility as much a part of deregulation as mergers and acquisitions,=
=20
no power producer wants to be caught with its assets unproductive, i.e. wit=
h=20
a shiny, new combined-cycle plant and no gas to fuel it.=20

""You can't put paper in a pipeline; you can't burn paper in a turbine,"" sai=
d=20
Donato Eassey, head of natural gas analysis for Merrill Lynch in Houston,=
=20
Texas.=20

""There are developing some real physical concerns for getting natural gas,=
=20
and we will see some reneging on deals=01*even with contracts.""=20

Olson has done the mathematics concerning the spike in demand related to ne=
w=20
plants=01*and the numbers don't work.=20

""To feed all the plants expected to come on-line in the next few years woul=
d=20

ng=20

te=20
of 0.4 Bcfd over the last 10 years=01*and well productivity has been down t=
he=20
last two years. We've simply been replacing our natural declines.""=20

Control what's there
To put it in the vernacular: If enough gas isn't going to be there, you=20
better control what you can. Thus, Calpine Corp. in February announced a de=
al=20
to acquire for $1.2 billion in stock and assumed debt the Calgary, Alberta,=
=20
Canada-based exploration and production (E&P) firm Encal Energy Ltd.=20


No power producer wants to be caught with a shiny, new combined-cycle plant=
=20
and no gas to fuel it.=20

The deal gave Calpine a solid foothold in satisfying part of its seemingly=
=20
insatiable need for natural gas fuel, as it marches toward 70,000 MW of=20
capacity within the next three years. With Encal, San Jose, Calif.-based=20
Calpine's proven and probable reserves jumped to 1.7 trillion cubic feet=20
(Tcf), with a daily production capacity of 390 million cubic feet equivalen=
t=20
(MMcfe).=20

Earlier this month, Williams Cos. pushed oil behemoth Royal Dutch/Shell Gro=
up=20
out of the way and snared independent E&P player Barrett Resources Corp. fo=
r=20
$1.5 billion in cash, stock and assumed debt.=20

Williams' offer was music to Barrett shareholders' ears: At $73 per share,=
=20
the price was some 60% above Barrett's stock price the day before Shell's=
=20
unsolicited bid became a hostile offer in March.=20

Two weeks ago, another independent E&P player took the money and ran. San=
=20
Francisco-based HS Resources agreed to $66 a share=01*a 24% premium=01*$1.7=
 billion=20
in cash, stock and assumed debt from Kerr-McGee Corp. Not bad for a stock=
=20
trading around $20 a year ago=01*and around $5 a share in early 1999.=20

As was the case with Calpine's swallowing of Encal, Williams and Kerr-McGee=
=20
were thinking one thing when they bid the roof off: natural gas reserves.=
=20
Williams' proven reserves, including Barrett, more than doubled to 3.3=20
trillion cubic feet equivalent (Tcfe), while average daily production jumpe=
d=20
to 555 MMcfe.=20

Kerr-McGee gains via the HS Resources deal 1.3 Tcfe, about a 77% increase,=
=20
while daily production will climb 45%.

""Williams looked at Barrett using wellhead-to-power plant economics,""=20
according to Stuart Wagner, a principal in the Denver office of investment=
=20
banking firm Petrie Parkman. ""It was looking at long-lived, low-risk=20
reserves.""=20

More deals a no-brainer
Generators today cannot take the chance natural gas will not be available=
=20
when that 500-MW or 1,000-MW plant is set to be primed.=20

""If you are building the plants and you don't have the gas, you are down th=
e=20
tubes,"" Merrill Lynch's Eassey said. ""If you are down a day in this market,=
=20
you're sunk. And buying gas in the ground is cheaper than buying it on the=
=20
market.""

""The firms already have a market for their power, now they are locking in=
=20
margins,"" said Phillip Pace, an energy analyst in Houston with Credit Suiss=
e=20
First Boston. ""It depends on how short you want to be. One hundred percent=
=20
short=01*you don't want to be.""=20

Thus, there will be more plays made for sister firms to Barrett and HS=20
Resources, industry watchers believe. The acquisition of independent E&P=20
players is heating up.=20

""Will we see more deals? That's a no-brainer,"" said Merrill's Eassey. ""You=
=20
think Equitable (Pittsburgh, Pa.-based Equitable Resources Inc., the larges=
t=20
holder of gas in the Appalachian region) is trading around $80 a share on i=
ts=20
fundamental valuation? That's not fundamentals=01*that's takeout.""=20

National Fuel is another takeout target, said Eassey. Another analyst, who=
=20
requested anonymity, believes Mitchell Energy & Development Corp., Louis=20
Dreyfus Natural Gas and Burlington Resources are choice targets. Petrie=20
Parkman's Wagner sees Mitchell and Western Gas Resources Inc. as takeout=20
material.


Olson calls Mitchell his ""dream"" acquisition. The 55-year-old firm, founded=
=20
by 81-year-old wildcatter George Mitchell, may be the choicest plum still t=
o=20
be picked. Mitchell put his firm on the block last year but has yet to hear=
=20
numbers he likes.=20

""Gas production at Mitchell is up 25% this year, and is projected at 20%=20
through 2003,"" Olson said. ""It's finding very rich gas in the Barnett=20
Formation in North Texas, but even if you're finding it at 70 cents per Mcf=
=20
(thousand cubic feet), if you can sell it for $4 to $5 per Mcf, that works.=
""=20

Proven gas reserves are in the 1.5 Tcf range, with daily production of=20
roughly 340 MMcfd. Mitchell's stock price has more than doubled in the last=

year, closing May 23 at $56.55.=20

A crowded field of acquirers
With potential acquisitions awaiting, which companies are the promising=20

(Published May 30, 2001)=20

and political factors that interact with one another in ways that defy=20

CAROLYN COLE / Los Angeles Times

?????President Bush, venturing into California for the first time as=20
president, stood firm Tuesday in his opposition to reining in wholesale=20
electricity prices, prompting Gov. Gray Davis to announce that he likely wi=
ll=20
sue federal energy regulators within a month.
?????In their much-anticipated private summit, Bush met with Davis for near=
ly=20
40 minutes in what was characterized afterward as a cordial, businesslike=
=20
session. Davis said Bush offered little to help with California's energy=20
crisis, while Bush's aides said Davis' prescription would worsen the state'=
s=20
woes.
?????""He just listened and said he is against price caps,"" Davis said.
?????For his part, the president said in a midday speech to the World Affai=
rs=20
Council in Century City: ""My administration will continue to work to help=
=20
California through the difficult months ahead.""
?????The president's first full day in California consisted largely of=20
appearances before friendly audiences. The only discord came at the World=
=20
Affairs Council luncheon, where three hecklers disrupted his otherwise=20
well-received speech on energy and the economy, and a few dozen protesters=
=20
gathered outside the Century City hotel.
?????Davis toned down his harsh rhetoric of recent days, praising Bush for=
=20
speeding up the process by which the federal government grants permits to n=
ew=20
power plants.
?????The governor said Bush agreed to begin looking into natural gas=20
prices--a step that Davis praised. Natural gas, which fuels virtually all n=
ew=20
power plants being built in California and many of the old ones, costs=20
roughly three times more in California than in New York.
?????The big disagreement remains over the wholesale cost of electricity. T=
he=20
state spent $7 billion on electricity in 1999. The cost could skyrocket to=
=20
$50 billion this year.
?????""We have an agreement to disagree, but it is a big disagreement,"" Davi=
s=20
said.
?????The Davis administration has appealed to the Federal Energy Regulatory=
=20
Commission to impose some type of price controls on electricity. Davis said=
=20
he expects to sue within a month, if the federal commission turns down the=
=20
state's latest petition, which was filed Friday. Also Tuesday, a federal=20
appeals court rejected a lawsuit by state legislative leaders to force=20
Washington energy regulators to cap electricity prices in California.
?????""I'm going to pursue every recourse possible to me,"" Davis said, addin=
g=20
that he also will press his case on behalf of California and other Western=
=20
states with the newly Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate.
?????The Bush-Davis meeting was almost twice as long as the 20 minutes=20
allotted on the president's public schedule. On his first visit to the=20
nation's most populous state since taking office four months ago, Bush came=
=20
face to face throughout the day with the reality of the energy crisis and i=
ts=20
potential for dragging down the economy of California and the nation.

?????'Price Caps Now,' Heckler Tells Bush
?????Bush was thrust into the controversy that the crisis has engendered: A=
t=20
the luncheon speech, one woman stood up and shouted, ""Price caps now!"" and=
=20
""Stop the greedy generators!"" As she was slowly led out, two other women=20
echoed her cries, including one who stated primly, ""Excuse me, Mr. Bush, we=
=20
need price caps.""
?????Medea Benjamin, a California Green Party candidate for the U.S. Senate=
=20
last year, was one of the three women ushered out.
?????Benjamin and 79-year-old Ceil Sorensen were unfurling a banner inside=
=20
the hotel when they were ushered out, said Donna J. Warren, a Green Party=
=20
candidate for the 32nd Congressional District seat. The women were released=
=20
within 30 minutes, Warren said. The president continued his speech, making =
no=20
reference to the interruptions.
?????Meanwhile, a group of economists--among them aides to former President=
=20
Reagan and to Bush's father--sent Bush a letter opposing price caps,=20
countering another letter from economists delivered by Davis supporting=20
temporary steps to stabilize California's electricity market.
?????The president, sounding defensive after coming under attack in a state=
=20
in which he faces wide skepticism about his policies and his poll numbers a=
re=20
drooping, said in an apparent slap at Davis:
?????""For too long, too often, too many have wasted energy, pointing finger=
s=20
and laying blame. Energy is a problem that requires action, not politics, n=
ot=20
excuses but action. Blame shifting is not action, it's a distraction.""
?????Bush's day began at dawn in Los Angeles. He flew to Camp Pendleton,=20
where Marines demonstrated their energy conservation efforts. Speaking to a=
n=20
assembly of Marines in front of the 1st Marine Division headquarters, Bush=
=20
was cheered and greeted with several throaty chants of ""hoo-aah"" from the=
=20
approving leathernecks.
?????After the speech in Los Angeles, he took part in a meeting on energy=
=20
efficiency and then met with the governor. At the end of the day, he flew t=
o=20
Fresno, for a visit today to Sequoia National Park.
?????Andrew H. Card Jr., Bush's chief of staff, said after the meeting with=
=20
Davis: ""It was a very, very friendly and constructive conversation."" Davis=
=20
described the session as cordial and businesslike.
?????Card said that the two found areas in which they agreed to disagree, b=
ut=20
that there were more areas of agreement.
?????Card also said Bush told Davis that he had asked Pat Wood, a power=20
utility official in Texas whom he has named to the Federal Energy Regulator=
y=20
Commission, to visit with the governor to explore the state's energy proble=
ms.
?????The day had the feel of two intersecting political campaigns.
?????Bush tried to show that he cared about California's woes; Davis=20
surrounded himself with ""real Californians,"" including three young children=
.=20
The group was handpicked by the governor's aides to illustrate the effect o=
f=20
rising electricity bills.
?????""I had hoped [Bush] might have been able to hear the stories directly,=
""=20
Davis said before his private meeting with the president. He sat on a couch=
=20
on the 19th floor of the Century Plaza, with three young children, and=20
listened to their parents and others discuss their worries about rising bil=

and fears about blackouts.
?????Linking a thriving economy to a reliable, affordable energy supply, Bu=
sh=20
said all his work on energy would be guided by this test: ""Will any action=

equitable ways? Anything that meets that test will alleviate the shortage,=
=20
and we will move swiftly to adopt it.
?????""Price caps do nothing to reduce demand, and they do nothing to increa=

restrictions.
?????He said they may sound appealing ""at first blush for those struggling =

Critics of price caps argue that they would make production of energy=20

.
?????In a nod to concerns that energy companies are taking advantage of the=

shortages, Bush said the federal government ""takes very seriously our=20

?????Energy Problems Detailed to Media
?????To the surprise of no one in the Davis administration, Bush did not=20
adjust his schedule to listen to Davis' Californians with energy problems.
?????So Davis held a news conference where they could tell their stories,=

then appeared with them in interviews with reporters from national televisi=

?????""I'm surprised [Bush] wouldn't meet with this group, and I'm surprised=

emphysema. ""What can you do in 20 minutes, other than say, 'No.' ""

Power Plant Start-Up Comes a Year Early=20
Energy: The MWD hydroelectric facility is the state's first new one in six=
=20
years, just in time for summer crisis.=20

By TONY PERRY, Times Staff Writer=20

?????A year earlier than initially planned, the Metropolitan Water District=
=20
of Southern California will begin producing electricity today at its mammot=
h=20
reservoir near Hemet in Riverside County.
?????Four turbines at MWD's Diamond Valley Lake reservoir will produce abou=
t=20
13 megawatts of electricity--enough for about 9,750 homes.
?????The move comes as the state approaches a summer for which energy=20
officials have predicted rolling blackouts.
?????""In this crisis, every kilowatt counts,"" said Ronald Gastelum, MWD=20
general manager.
?????For anyone looking for a microcosm of what the energy crisis has done =
to=20
change California's thinking, the four roaring turbines at Diamond Valley=
=20
Lake are a good place to start.
?????For openers, the California Energy Commission says the power plant at=
=20
the Hiram J. Wadsworth Pumping Plant is the first new California=20
hydroelectric facility in six years--a period during which demand was=20
increasing and supply remained static.
?????Also, the hydroelectric turbines were not part of the original design =
of=20
the $2-billion reservoir. ""There was plenty of power in the state,"" Gastelu=
m=20
said. ""Hydroelectric was not a priority.""
?????But as the state tumbled into energy disarray, the MWD board voted to=
=20
retrofit some of the reservoir's pumps to produce electricity.
?????If all 12 pumps are altered to act as power generators--at a cost of=
=20
about $4.5 million--the output will be about 40 megawatts, enough for 30,00=
0=20
homes.
?????Opened in March 2000, the Diamond Valley reservoir is scheduled to hol=
d=20
800,000 acre-feet of water when full. Energy will be generated by running=
=20
water through the turbines before it is sent either to Riverside County=20
agencies or south to its largest customer, the San Diego County Water=20
Authority.
?????The MWD also is considering how to upgrade its transmission lines to=
=20
draw more electricity from existing hydroelectric plants at Hoover and Park=
er=20
dams on the Colorado River.
?????Furthermore, the MWD is looking for other locations to generate power=
=20
along its complex system of aqueducts and canals, and is mulling proposals =
to=20
become partners with would-be power plant builders who need water for cooli=
ng.
?????The megawatts produced at Diamond Valley will be sold to the state's=
=20
Independent System Operator, rather than Southern California Edison Co. or=
=20
Pacific Gas & Electric Co.--and that too is a sign of how the energy shorta=
ge=20
has changed things in California.
?????The MWD has long-term contracts to provide energy to Edison and PG&E=
=20
from some of its 15 other hydroelectric facilities. But those financially=
=20
shaky companies now owe MWD about $2 million each, and so the MWD decided t=
o=20
sell to the ISO instead.
?????Beyond serving the state, the MWD stands to make money by selling powe=
r=20
and increasing its stake in the energy business. It plans to use the profit=
s=20
to pay some of its own electricity bill, which has increased by $110 millio=
n=20
this year.
?????With a fast-track approval process from the Federal Energy Regulatory=
=20
Commission, the four 6,000-horsepower pumps were converted in the past two=
=20
months to be ready to produce energy for the peak-usage period of each day=
=20
during the summer.
?????""We don't have all the whistles and bells on it,"" said David Gledhill,=
=20
principal engineer and project manager for the MWD. ""It is more bare-bones=
=20
than our other facilities, but it's operational.""

THE ENERGY CRUNCH=20
Bush, Davis fail to settle dispute=20

Los Angeles -- President Bush and Gov. Gray Davis, who have sparred=20
long-distance for weeks about California's power woes, clashed in person=20
yesterday over their vastly different views on the need for energy price=20
controls.=20
Bush, in a speech before the World Affairs Council in Los Angeles, argued=
=20
that California's energy crisis demands ""action, not politics, not excuses,=
""=20
and he ruled out federal price controls on the wholesale costs of energy,=
=20
saying, ""We will not take any action that makes California's problems worse=
.""=20
Davis, however, argued that California's consumers are getting ""a raw deal""=
=20
without price limits. He said he will sue the federal government to impose=
=20
controls, which he deems essential to fixing the state's energy problems.=
=20
Emerging from a 35-minute meeting with Bush -- nearly twice as long as=20
scheduled -- Davis said the session was ""informational, businesslike"" but ""=
we=20
still have a fundamental disagreement over whether or not California is=20
entitled to price relief.""=20
""I don't think it's a matter of philosophy or ideology. It's a matter of=20
law,"" Davis said.=20
Federal agencies ""made a determination in November, and again Dec. 15, that=
=20
the California market was dysfunctional, prices were too high, . . . and we=
=20
are entitled to some form of price relief,"" the governor said.=20
Davis warned that without price controls the state would spend $50 billion =
on=20
power, which could send the economy spiraling down and affect the nation.=
=20
The meeting, although described by both sides as cordial, highlighted deep=
=20
philosophical and political differences between Bush and Davis over the=20
state's energy crunch. Those opposing views have been underscored by=20
increasingly harsh rhetoric between top Bush administration officials,=20
including Vice President Dick Cheney, and the governor and his top aides.=
=20
Energy has dominated the California political landscape in a way no one cou=
ld=20
have predicted during last fall's campaign. Field Polls released last week=
=20
show Californians are disappointed in the performance of both men on the=20
energy front. Rolling blackouts and rising utility bills account in large=
=20
part for an 18 percentage point drop in the once-popular Davis' job approva=
l=20
rating from January to May, analysts say.=20
Bush's first trip to California as president is intended to counter the=20
governor's repeated criticism that he has not helped the state solve the=20
energy crisis. Both men tried to spin the trip -- and yesterday's personal=
=20
meeting -- to gain a measure of public support.=20
Political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe said Bush's visit could help him=20
repair his image in California, where Davis has tied the president to big o=
il=20
interests.=20
BULLY PULPIT
""For too long, (Bush) has ceded the bully pulpit to the governor,"" allowing=
=20
him to be tied to ""oil buddies"" in Texas, Jeffe said after the president's=
=20
speech in Los Angeles. ""Did he sound like an oil guy today? I was looking=
=20
around for the tree he was gonna hug.""=20
In a 22-minute speech to an audience of several hundred, Davis among them,=
=20
Bush said, ""for too long -- and too often -- too many have wasted energy=20
pointing fingers and laying blame. . . . Energy is a problem that requires=
=20
not excuses, but action. And blame shifting is not action -- it is a=20
distraction.""=20
Bush repeated his opposition to price limits, which, he said, ""do nothing t=
o=20
reduce demand, and they do nothing to increase supply.""=20
Davis and other Democrats, including California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, have=
=20
for months urged Bush to order price controls. Garry South, Davis' senior=
=20
political adviser, charged yesterday that Bush, not the governor, was playi=
ng=20
politics with California's future.=20
The president must come to grips with ""the notion that adhering to rigid=20
ideology in the face of an existing law, which requires him to act, is not=
=20
just some kind of a face off with the governor of California,"" South said.=
=20
""It actually endangers the national economy.""=20
'GREEDY ENERGY COMPANIES'=20
Bush's speech, which addressed trade, the economy and tax issues as well as=
=20
energy, was interrupted by lengthy heckling from three protesters, includin=
g=20
former Green Party U.S. Senate candidate Medea Benjamin. The protesters,=20
yelling ""stop the greedy energy companies,"" and ""price caps now,"" were=20
hustled out, and one was arrested.=20
But the president, to warm applause, pressed on with his talk, saying that=
=20
the administration has taken specific steps to assist California, including=
=20
working with Davis ""to speed the approval of new power plants, expand=20
electricity production, and increase the flow of natural gas into the state=
.""=20
Bush also stressed conservation as ""an important part of the energy=20
equation."" He said his proposed energy plan ""encourages renewable sources o=
f=20
energy, including ""safe and clean nuclear power, wind, solar, biomass.""=20
And the president repeated his commitment to uphold the moratorium on=20
offshore oil drilling in California.=20
Bush also said he will take aggressive action to ensure that consumers are=
=20
protected against price gougers.=20
""The federal government takes very seriously our responsibility to make sur=
e=20
that companies are not illegally gouging consumers,"" he said. ""We will=20
protect consumers against abuses.""=20
In Los Angeles, and earlier in the day at Camp Pendleton near San Diego, Bu=
sh=20
attempted to dismiss the debate over energy as political posturing.=20
'TIME TO PUT ASIDE POLITICS'=20
""It's time to put aside politics and focus on the best interests of the=20
people,"" he told several hundred Marines at Camp Pendleton. ""This is no tim=
e=20
for harsh rhetoric. This is no time for name calling. It is time for=20
leadership. It is time for results.""=20
Bush said he will ask Congress to appropriate $150 million for ""low-income=
=20
energy assistance"" in addition to the $300 million for such aid already in=
=20
his budget.=20
The president also said he will direct Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham to=
=20
smooth the way for permits and easements needed to ""unplug the Path 15=20
bottleneck"" -- a problem with the transmission grid that restricts the flow=
=20
of energy from Southern to Northern California.=20
Before their private meeting, Bush and Davis met in a closed-to-the-press=
=20
session with a dozen business leaders, including the heads of Santa Clara's=
=20
Intel Corp. and National Semiconductor Corp., to discuss the energy crisis.=
=20
""Both the governor and the president seemed fairly inquisitive,"" said one=
=20
participant, John Woolard, chief executive of Alameda software-maker Silico=
n=20
Energy Corp. ""They wanted to know what was actually realistic to solve the=
=20
problems.""=20
That 45-minute meeting, also attended by Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan,=
=20
apparently went more Bush's way than Davis. The business leaders supported=
=20
the president's calls for entrepreneurs to help solve California's troubles=
,=20
and no one brought up the topic of price controls.=20
Woolard said Bush and Davis ""seemed surprisingly comfortable with one=20
another,"" although it was Bush who clearly was in charge of the talks.=20
Overall, he said, Bush was ""sympathetic to California's problem and wanted =
to=20
do whatever he could, within certain constraints.""=20
Price limits, Woolard concluded, obviously were one such constraint.=20

The spinmeisters worked overtime to control yesterday's George Bush- Gray=

Davis energy shootout -- but from the looks of things, Davis' folks got the=

The White House had tried to dodge a punch by scheduling the Davis-Bush=20
meeting too late for the national evening news -- but Davis' people didn't=
=20
miss a beat.=20
They held a little premeeting gathering of their own up in the governor's=

invited a group of people from San Diego to come in and tell their energy=

And wouldn't you know it, all the national press was invited to Davis'=20
meeting as well.=20
The governor then did separate ""sit-downs"" with five national networks. And=

that didn't include the network morning shows he appeared on just to get=20

""It was pretty clear that the Bush team wanted the president's Camp Pendlet=

Then, of course, there were the battling postpresidential-confab news=20
conferences: Davis on the ground floor, and Bush advisers Gerald Parsky and=

But again Davis got the upper hand -- 18 TV cameras showed up for the=20

""The meeting never should have happened in the first place,"" said former U.=
=20
S. Secretary of Energy (and former state GOP chairman) John Herrington.=20
In Herrington's view, it was clear from the start that Davis was ""just goin=

to use the meeting to kick the stuffing out of the president.""=20
And if there was to be a meeting, he says, it should have included some=20
Republican legislators who support the president's energy plan.=20
""That way, they would at least have people coming out on the president's=20
side,"" Herrington said. ""This way, Bush just comes off as Davis' scapegoat.=
""=20
And with every move, an ever-courteous Davis played the role to the hilt,=

LOS ANGELES -- Gov. Gray Davis and President Bush ended weeks of harsh=20

Bush remained unmoved in his opposition to the price caps California=20
officials have sought. And Davis emerged from their 35-minute meeting=20

``On the big enchilada, the thing that matters above all else, temporary=20

said Davis, who presented Bush with a briefing book describing the state's=

Davis had little reason to be optimistic heading into the meeting. Shortly=

most extensive comments to date on California's energy troubles.=20
``We will not take any action that makes California's problems worse -- and=

that's why I oppose price caps,'' Bush said in a speech to the Los Angeles=

White House officials said price caps would discourage conservation by=20

But Davis said price caps are the only way the state can rein in the soarin=

And Davis emphasized his belief that federal law requires regulators in=20

``While the president and I have a fundamental disagreement over whether or=

the governor -- then indirectly criticized Davis and other Democrats for=20
their pointed attacks on his energy positions.=20
``For too long and too often, too many have wasted energy pointing fingers=

people protesting his opposition to price caps. ``Energy is a problem that=

Bush may be correct to say that we can produce our way out of the current=

With good reason, some say.=20
California is the nation's largest farming state. Between 500,000 and 1.1=

Average Californians are paying up to 35 percent more for power. Farmers=20

``Clearly agriculture is unique,'' said Michael Boccadoro, an industry=20
lobbyist. ``Agriculture is going to be probably the hardest hit industry in=

In Sacramento, Boccadoro has been involved in every major policy decision=

Within days, the proposal that farmers feared would put too much control of=
=20
water in state hands was dead. And with it went an early opportunity to=20
prevent PG&E from falling into bankruptcy.=20
Agriculture's influence became very public last month when its lobbyists=20
helped orchestrate a legislative ambush that stunned even some veteran=20
lawmakers.=20
For weeks, state Sen. Byron Sher, D-Redwood City, had been working to cobbl=

together a $1 billion conservation program meant to cut energy demand=20
dramatically this summer.=20
But lawmakers from the Central Valley -- the heart of farm country -- refus=

to back the measure until Sher included special perks for agriculture.=20
The bill languished as legislators tried to work out a compromise.=20
Sher agreed to rewrite the bill to include millions to help farmers buy=20
low-polluting equipment. Apparently, it wasn't enough.=20
Agricultural lobbyists turned to supporters in the Assembly. As Sher stood =
up=20
to present his bill in the Assembly Appropriations Committee, the house=20
Democratic leaders directed the chairwoman to add new agricultural perks to=
=20
the delicately balanced bill.=20
``That was the part that took me back,'' Sher said, recalling his=20
frustration. ``But you roll with the punches.''=20
Farmers were seeking special limits on the amount of time they could be=20
forced to shut off their power during energy emergencies. And they wanted=
=20
permission to run high-polluting diesel generators when they were blacked=
=20
out.=20
State Sen. Mike Machado, D-Stockton, a farmer who pushed for the various=20
changes, said it was important for state leaders to consider how agricultur=

fits into California's ``economic fabric.''=20
``I use computer technology in my farm, in my tractor, so I need Silicon=20

Other industries=20
But other legislators said there was no rational reason to treat agricultur=

``If you make a straight-up case about why you should be exempted, it's=20

Bush was more than halfway through his 10-minute speech when he brought up=
=20
the subject of energy conservation. He began by praising Camp Pendleton and=

federal agencies for heeding his May 3 order to take extra steps to conserv=

itself to reducing its energy consumption by 10 percent during peak hours.=

""I'm pleased to report that the military and federal agencies are exceeding=

A rush to duck power outages: About half of the state's electric users=20
already have been exempted from rolling blackouts.
By Carrie Peyton, Terri Hardy and Clint Swett
Bee Staff Writers
(Published May 31, 2001)=20
Up and down California, businesses, government agencies, campuses and other=
s=20
are scrambling to join the millions who will escape this summer's predicted=
=20
waves of rolling blackouts.=20
Some have gotten state regulators to change blackout rules. Some have given=
=20
different versions of their needs to utilities, changing their stories in=
=20
ways that satisfy exemption standards. Some have persuaded legislators to=
=20
propose laws just for them.=20
""People that have political power or economic power are going to find ways =
of=20
getting exempted. It happens all the time,"" said Richard Bilas, one of five=
=20
appointed members of the state Public Utilities Commission.=20
Every addition to the largely confidential list of those exempt from outage=
s=20
boosts the frequency of blackouts for everyone else.=20
While a few thousand institutions -- including hospitals, fire departments=
=20
and prisons -- are deemed ""essential"" users who should not be blacked out,=
=20
nearly half the state is spared outages because millions more share circuit=
s=20
with those exempt facilities.=20
In Sacramento, for example, the electric utility will not cut power to a=20
water treatment facility along the American River for fear of endangering=
=20
water quality. But sheltering that circuit also spares the sprawling=20
California State University, Sacramento, campus nearby.=20
If exemptions grow, ""at some point, you lose the ability to reliably have=
=20
rolling blackouts,"" said PUC commissioner Carl Wood. He has estimated that=
=20
fewer than 1,000 more institutions can be exempted without compromising the=
=20
system that rolls outages from one part of the state to the next when the=
=20
electric grid can't supply power for everyone.=20
With close to half of the state sitting out outages, ""that means the other=
=20
half is going to get blacked out twice as often. It's basically unfair to t=
he=20
rest of the community,"" said Paul Perkovic, who sits on the board of the=20
Montara Sanitary District, which provides sewer, garbage and other services=
=20
to a San Mateo County community.=20
Perkovic urged the PUC last week to make more government agencies, includin=
g=20
his tiny district, eligible for blackouts, arguing that they should be=20
prepared for other emergencies anyway.=20
The deluge of exemption requests has created a dilemma of values and number=
s.=20
Should nursing homes be placed on the essential list? What about outpatient=
=20
surgical clinics or transit agencies or schools? And when, if ever, should=
=20
someone review existing exemptions to see if they're still needed?=20
Utilities and regulators say they try to apply the rules fairly. But=20
inconsistencies appear, and the rules keep changing as the realization sink=
s=20
in that many more blackouts could await California.=20
The state's two biggest utilities are close in size, but one shields about =
25=20
percent more customers than the other from outages.=20
The Sacramento Municipal Utility District, which sets its own outage=20
standards, exempts only 21 of its 530,000 customers.=20
Pacific Gas and Electric Co., which applies rules set by the PUC, is much=
=20
more generous, giving 2,600 of its 4.8 million customers the ""get out of=20
blackouts free card.""=20
Southern California Edison is even more open handed in its interpretation o=
f=20
the same rules, doling out 3,600 exemptions among its 4.3 million customers=
.=20
The roads to getting an exemption are varied. There are at least three plac=
es=20
to start for those who want to stay cool and bright when all around are goi=
ng=20
dark.=20
Businesses or governments can apply to their utility, which determines=20
whether they fit rules for a public safety exemption.=20
Or if their utility is regulated by the PUC, they can apply directly to a n=
ew=20
program set up to examine their petition for exemptions.=20
Finally, they can go to the state Legislature, where lawmakers have=20
introduced a range of bills that would protect schools, nursing homes,=20
refineries -- even Universal Studios.=20
But in the attempt to quickly piece together a system to grant exemptions,=
=20
critics say, a haphazard process has been developed.=20
Dan Johnson, associate vice president for facilities development and=20
operations at San Jose State University, said he has sought an exemption fr=
om=20
PG&E and is still waiting, while campuses with similar circumstances have=
=20
succeeded. Now he wonders about the fairness of what seems to him a murky=
=20
decision-making process.=20
""Each utility has its own way of dealing with exemptions,"" he said. ""If it=
=20
appears that the decision is arbitrary and capricious, we hope that when we=
=20
appeal to the PUC some sanity prevails.""=20
One person in PG&E's tariff's department has done nothing but process=20
exemption requests since March, officials said, after the job became too bi=
g=20
to be absorbed in another worker's duties.=20
About 200 requests have come in since early this year, and PG&E has approve=
d=20
45 of them and denied 72, with 79 still pending.=20
The process is aimed at being a straightforward evaluation of whether an=20
entity fits into existing PUC categories of ""essential"" customers.=20
But it isn't always that simple, said Roland Risser, PG&E director of tarif=
fs=20
and compliance.=20
Sometimes, said Risser, a customer will say it has adequate backup=20
generation, and PG&E will let the customer know the backup disqualifies it=
=20
from an exemption. Later, the customer calls back and says ""we've=20
re-evaluated"" and the backup generator won't supply all its needs.=20
""We just take their word for it,"" Risser said. ""We don't police.""=20
From universities to transit agencies, a wide range of customers worry that=
=20
as different utilities apply PUC standards, those regulations don't always=
=20
yield the same results.=20
So far, at least eight campuses within the University of California and CSU=
=20
systems will not be subject to rolling blackouts, including UC Davis.=20
In a letter to PG&E asking for an exemption, UC Davis stressed the potentia=
l=20
danger to animals in its veterinary hospital and the possible destruction o=
f=20
research. But PG&E spokesman Ron Low said health and safety arguments are t=
he=20
only ones that matter. PG&E granted the exemption because the campus does n=
ot=20
have generators for its airport and its radio station -- which is part of t=
he=20
emergency broadcasting network.=20
Transportation officials say they're frustrated by the mixed signals sent b=
y=20
utilities.=20
While the PUC has declared the Bay Area Rapid Transit District exempt from=
=20
blackouts, Edison says Los Angeles' Municipal Transportation Authority is=
=20
not. Ralph de la Cruz, deputy executive director of operations for the MTA,=
=20
doesn't understand that logic. True, BART travels under the bay. But the=20
MTA's Green Line runs down the middle of the I-105 Century Freeway. Some MT=
A=20
rail lines are elevated, and passengers trying to extricate themselves from=
 a=20
stalled train could plunge to the ground.=20
The MTA asked Edison to reconsider and has appealed to the PUC.=20
""We are anxious to see this resolved as quickly as possible, before blackou=
ts=20
occur,"" de la Cruz said. ""My God, we don't want to be in the position of ou=
r=20
lines experiencing the prospect of stranded passengers.""=20
The San Francisco Giants also have appealed to the PUC to be exempt during=
=20
games. A blackout at Pacific Bell Park would ""pose major operational=20
challenges,"" said Staci Slaughter, a Giants' spokeswoman.=20
Electric turnstiles wouldn't work. Concession stands could only accept cash=
=20
only for hot dogs and beers. The field would go dark and night games would=
=20
have to be canceled.=20
The PUC has been so swamped with bids to escape blackouts that it has hired=
 a=20
scientific and engineering consulting firm to study who else should be adde=
d.=20
Meanwhile, it has asked utilities to look into ways to reconfigure the wiri=
ng=20
so that each essential customer won't take so many nonessential ones out of=
=20
the blackout pool. A report on those efforts is due Friday.=20
""We've been deluged at the commission by individual requests that do have a=
=20
broader public policy good,"" said PUC president Loretta Lynch, including on=
e=20
from the lone U.S. maker of a blood-clotting agent for hemophiliacs.=20
The PUC has hired Exponent, a Menlo Park consulting firm, for $615,000 to=
=20
analyze who else should be exempt.=20
Exemption applications are due Friday and will be reviewed by people with=
=20
specialties ranging from toxicology to environmental sciences to electrical=
=20
engineering, said Robert Caligiuri, an Exponent vice president.=20
The company will rank applicants based on safety risks, and it will work wi=
th=20
utilities to determine the potential impacts of adding each one to the=20
exemption pool. It will report to the commission in July, and Wood expects =
a=20
decision in early August. He hopes the new rules can be implemented by=20
utilities soon after.=20
But no one within the PUC is taking an equally rigorous look at those who a=
re=20
already exempt, and the commission is split on whether such a study is=20
necessary. Wood, who specializes in the blackout issue, believes that the=
=20
commission simply doesn't have the time for such an effort during the curre=
nt=20
emergency.=20
Unsure of their prospects with utilities or the PUC, some are taking their=
=20
cases to the Capitol.=20
State Sen. Sheila Kuehl, D-Santa Monica, said lawmakers are scrambling to=
=20
draft energy policies that help all Californians, and at the same time, loo=
k=20
after interests in their districts.=20
One example is Kuehl's bill that would allow 15 businesses -- including=20
Universal Studios -- which straddle the boundary between Edison and the Los=
=20
Angeles Department of Water and Power to get their electricity from DWP. No=
t=20
only would that deal provide them with cheaper rates, but it would likely=
=20
exempt them from blackouts.=20
The Los Angeles city utility is not part of the region controlled by the=20
state Independent System Operator, and so it functions independently when t=
he=20
ISO orders utilities to impose blackouts.=20
Kuehl said the proposal is fair because those businesses were harmed by a=
=20
""geographic quirk,"" where parts of the park are in DWP territory but they a=
re=20
solely an Edison customer.=20
""These are already DWP customers,"" Kuehl said. ""They should be able to draw=
=20
all their energy from DWP.""=20
Other lawmakers are carrying bills for public schools, oil refineries and=
=20
customers in areas where there are extreme temperatures. Sen. Richard=20
Polanco, D-Los Angeles, is proposing a law that would ensure municipal=20
utilities -- such as his district's DWP -- don't have to participate in=20
blackouts.=20
Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, chairwoman of the Senate energy=20
committee, said the state has to realize that not everyone can be exempt.=
=20
""All these bills that seek to put one group of folks in a better position=
=20
than someone else do is Balkanize the issue,"" Bowen said. ""Unfortunately,=
=20
instead of having people come together to try and share the pain equally,=

Sempra chief: County may fare OK on outages=20



By Kristen Green=20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20
May 31, 2001=20
San Diego County may be more insulated from blackouts this summer than the=
=20
rest of the state, the chief executive officer of Sempra Energy said=20
yesterday.=20
Stephen Baum said power supply shortages aren't as profound in Southern=20
California, in part, because the capabilities for importing energy are=20
better.=20
And that might mean Northern Californians will face more days in the dark=
=20
than San Diegans over the next three months, he said.=20

In a lecture at University of California San Diego yesterday, Baum, who=20
oversees San Diego Gas & Electric's parent company, said the state will=20
probably have at least 30 days of rolling blackouts this summer, an estimat=
e=20
often repeated by other energy experts.=20
But Baum hopes to limit San Diego County energy outages by introducing a=20
rolling blackout reduction program. Sempra is asking the state to support t=
he=20
program, which would give San Diego County credit for the energy that=20
businesses contribute to statewide energy supplies when electricity reserve=
s=20
drop dangerously low.=20
Local companies would turn on generators as the state nears blackouts, whic=
h=20
would make more energy available. In return, Sempra asks that the state=20
reduce the number of households that would be blacked out in San Diego=20
County. The state Public Utilities Commission has not considered the idea=
=20
yet.=20
State officials, however, have suggested that the program be applied=20
statewide. That would mean San Diego County businesses that run generators=
=20
would contribute to the state's energy supply, but the number of local=20
residents impacted by blackouts would not shrink.=20
During the afternoon lecture, attended by about 30 UCSD students and=20
visitors, Baum acknowledged the significance of President Bush's visit=20

The long-awaited ""Plan B"" from Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuy=
s,=20
is taking shape as legislative leaders are demanding that the governor reve=
al=20
detailed information about state power purchases, which total more than $7=

""You can't come to a solution of this problem until you know exactly what t=

Department of Water Resources is spending,"" said Senate President Pro Tempo=
re=20
John Burton, D-San Francisco.=20
A Davis spokesman said the administration expects to begin complying with t=
he=20
legislators' request soon. But there is a question about whether standard=
=20
confidentiality clauses prevent release of long-term contracts and concern=
=20
that revealing daily purchases would result in higher prices.=20
""The governor philosophically wants to release them as soon as possible,""=
=20
said Steve Maviglio, Davis' press secretary. ""We just want to make sure we=
=20
don't adversely affect our ability to get power at lower cost for the=20
summer.""=20
Reserve power levels dropped yesterday, and the state power grid operator=
=20
declared a Stage 2 alert for the first time in three weeks. The Independent=
=20
System Operator said some power plants were off-line for maintenance and ho=
t=20
weather across the state increased demand. Fewer imports were available=20
yesterday in comparison to last week.=20
Another reason legislative leaders are pushing for a full disclosure of sta=
te=20
spending on power is to help the Legislature prepare a new state budget for=
=20
the fiscal year that begins July 1.=20
""There are many reasons that having very precise numbers in that regard are=
=20
important to Sen. Burton and the speaker,"" said Assemblyman Fred Keeley,=20
D-Boulder Creek, who has been active on the power issue in the Legislature.=
=20
Keeley said disclosure of power spending costs might encourage Republican=
=20
legislators to provide an urgency vote allowing the prompt sale of a bond o=
f=20
up to $13.4 billion to repay the state general fund for the power purchases=
.=20
Without an urgency vote the state cannot begin issuing the massive bond=20
before late August, nearly two months into the new fiscal year. The bond=20
would be paid off by ratepayers over 15 years.=20
In addition, said Keeley, detailed information about state spending might=
=20
also lead to an agreement on legislation sought by Republicans that would=
=20
allow ""direct access"" purchase of electricity, where businesses and other=
=20
consumers contract with generators and marketers.=20
The state began buying power for utility customers in January after a faile=
d=20
deregulation plan, which froze customer rates as power costs soared, result=
ed=20
in a combined $13 billion debt for Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric and=
=20
left them unable to borrow.=20
After PG&E went into bankruptcy in early April, Davis quickly completed a=
=20
memorandum of understanding to purchase the Edison transmission system for=
=20
$2.76 billion as part of a plan to keep Edison out of bankruptcy and able t=
o=20
resume buying power for its customers by the end of next year.=20
But Republican legislators immediately opposed the state purchase of the=20
transmission system. Democratic legislators think the plan is too generous=
=20
for Edison and are reluctant to approve what consumer groups have called a=
=20
""bailout"" of the utility.=20
Burton said that before legislators can evaluate an alternative to the=20
governor's plan they need to know how much the state power purchasing agenc=
y,=20
the Department of Water Resources, is spending and how much money has been=
=20
committed for the future.=20
""Until we can find that out it's kind of tough to plan,"" Burton said.=20
Speaker Hertzberg has asked Keeley and senior Assembly staff members to=20
prepare the documents for an alternative to the governor's plan that=20
Hertzberg is expected to propose in a few days.=20
""The transmission purchase is not featured as prominently as it was in the=
=20
governor's proposal,"" Keeley said.=20
One of the options considered by the Assembly Democratic ""Plan B"" group was=
 a=20
proposal by Assemblymen John Dutra of Fremont and Joe Nation of San Rafael=
=20
that would give the state the option of purchasing the Edison transmission=
=20
system for $1.2 billion within five years.=20
A key part of both the governor's plan and the Dutra-Nation proposal is=20
giving Edison part of the revenue from monthly utility bills, a ""dedicated=
=20
rate component,"" that could be used to pay off Edison's debt and allow the=
=20
utility to resume buying power.=20
Both plans also would require Edison to make other concessions, including=
=20
providing low-cost power and the return of a $400 million tax refund that=
=20
Edison gave to its parent firm. Generators would be asked to forgive 30=20
percent of what they are owed.=20
Assembly Republicans said last week that what the state should receive in=
=20
exchange for aiding Edison is not the transmission system, but an agreement=
=20
that Edison would build new power plants to provide low-cost power.

But as California's energy crisis deepened, Gonzales' position became=20

in Chula Vista, which is owned by the San Diego Unified Port District and=

operated by Duke Energy under a lease.=20
One thing the new agency would not be doing is using the public power of=20

at=20
the proposed new agency would not have the power of eminent domain.=20
Wyland said he thought the original version of the bill was rejected by the=

initially wanted to create a new district without a vote of the people,=20
hoping to quickly get cheaper power.=20

the proposed new agency might be able to raise taxes.=20

groups in Escondido and San Marcos have been talking about creating municip=
al=20
utility districts in those cities.=20
Jim Madaffer, a San Diego city councilman, told the committee that he=20
believed the bill could allow streamlining and efficiencies and other steps=

that SDG&E might find beneficial.=20
""It's on that premise that I am here today,"" Madaffer said, ""and I believe=

Wright, who opposed the original version of the bill last week, joined in t=
he=20
13-to-0 vote for the new measure.=20
""You have a lot of work yet to do,"" Wright told Wyland.=20
The committee also approved a bill by Assemblyman Jay La Suer, R-La Mesa,=

that would require the SDG&E ""balancing account"" debt to be paid off by=20

More than four months into his presidency, Bush yesterday made his first=20
public appearances in California as president of the United States.=20
The president met with Marines and their families at Camp Pendleton in the=
=20
early morning, then traveled to Los Angeles, where he delivered a speech on=
=20
energy and economic policy to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council.=20
Summing up his approach to unpredictable electricity prices and supplies, t=
he=20
president said:=20
""My administration will continue to work to help California through the=20

stance Democrats have exploited to portray the Bush administration as a=20
lackey for profiteering energy companies.=20
""We will not take any action that makes California's problems worse. And=20
that's why I oppose price caps,"" he said. ""At first blush, for those=20
struggling to pay high energy bills, price caps may sound appealing. But=20
their result will ultimately be more serious shortages and therefore even=

An long-distance war of words between Democrat Davis and Republican=20
administration officials, particularly Vice President Dick Cheney, has=20
escalated in recent weeks over energy policy.=20
With Davis two seats away on the World Affairs Council dais, Bush pointedly=
=20
called for an end to the acrimony.=20
""For too long, too often, too many have wasted energy pointing fingers and=

Leading up to yesterday's meeting was a week of posturing by spokesmen for=

the two leaders on seemingly every detail, including who invited whom to th=

But when the two met -- Bush and Davis are casual acquaintances from their=

as devoid of rancor as it apparently was of productivity.=20
""The meeting was cordial, informational, businesslike,"" Davis said.=20
As Davis told it, he even deployed the only remaining weapon in his=20
gubernatorial arsenal -- the threat of a lawsuit -- delicately.=20
""I said, 'Mr. President, you understand I have to do everything in my power=

Hebert said. ""I feel very good about it.""
?????Responding to reporters' questions, Hebert also appeared to be unaware=
=20
of media reports that President Bush had asked a rival for his chairmanship=
,=20
Patrick Wood III, to play a special role in dealing with California's=20
problems.
?????Wood, a Bush confidant who until now had been chairman of the Texas=20

er=20
last week and is widely expected to be named to Hebert's job. The president=

?????White House officials said during Bush's visit to Los Angeles on Tuesd=

that Wood would follow up on concerns raised in the president's meeting wit=

?????Wood said in an interview that he talked briefly with Davis three week=

=20
his charge is vague: to review the entire situation.
?????""I'm looking at short-term things and long-term things,"" he said, noti=

that he had heard from lawmakers ""on both sides of the aisle"" complaining=

that FERC had not gone far enough.
?????Wood, who advocates a more activist role for FERC, said he wants to=20
monitor how the agency's efforts to limit price spikes in California are=20
working and that he might push for changes. Unlike Hebert, he said the=20
agency's standard for deciding whether a company has market power--enough=

to increasing the amount of rebates ordered to utilities for January.
?????And he said he thought FERC should also take another look at the desig=

The Home Energy Drain=20
How Appliances Draw Electricity, Even When Off=20

?????When devices such as stereos are turned off, we think of them as dead.=
=20
But it turns out they're only mostly dead. And mostly dead is a little bit=

alive.

?????For instance, have you ever wondered how a television set can understa=

the ""power on"" command from the remote control if the TV isn't using any=20
power at all? The fact is nearly all television sets--in fact, most home=20
appliances--use power as long as they're plugged in to a live electrical=20

Shopping for a Surge Supressor

-- DAVE WILSON


?????The cost of this drain probably isn't especially onerous to most=20
consumers. Leaving your answering machine plugged in all the time, for=20
instance, will cost you about 37 cents a month, assuming you're paying abou=
t=20
17 cents a kilowatt-hour.
?????The total cost of standby power probably is in the neighborhood of $10=
0=20
a year per household at current rates, though that figure will rise as=20
electricity becomes more expensive. Though that's not a vast sum to many=20
people, reducing electricity usage is critical to maintaining a steady powe=
r=20
supply in California.
?????The difference between a Stage 2 power emergency and Stage 3--the poin=
t=20
at which rolling blackouts kick in--is only 3.5% of total reserve electrica=
l=20
capacity. So cutting back on that leaking 10% in homes can make the=20
difference.
?????Not all the standby power is wasted. An answering machine is pretty=20
useless if it doesn't have access to power all the time since part of the=
=20
device's job is to be primed to pick up the phone if it should ring. It's=
=20
those other devices, such as the microwave oven clock that pulls power even=
=20
though nothing's being cooked, that are the problem. All devices that use=
=20
standby power could be designed to use as little electricity as possible.
?????Standby power drain is getting worse as more of the items we have in o=
ur=20
homes move from mechanical switches and timers to electronic controls. The=
=20
typical household today uses 7,000 kilowatt-hours of power each year.
?????Overall, residential consumption of power has risen 17.6%, from 68,000=
=20
gigawatt-hours in 1990 to an estimated 80,000 gigawatt-hours, according to=
=20
the California Energy Commission. Even when adjusted for population growth,=
=20
Californians use more power than they did 10 years ago--despite the fact th=
at=20
household appliances got more energy efficient.
?????One reason: We've got a lot more energy-gobbling devices in our homes.=
=20
For instance, Fred Johnson, who works in Silicon Valley's high-tech industr=
y,=20
has three TVs, each with a DVD player. He's also got two TiVo digital=20
recorder boxes, four computers and two stereo systems.
?????""Fortunately, it's not all on simultaneously,"" he said.
?????Another reason for the increase in power draw is a simultaneous increa=
se=20
in the number of devices that are always on. For instance, older microwave=
=20
ovens used a mechanical timer, which means the device didn't draw power=20
unless the oven was actually heating something up. Newer ovens use electron=
ic=20
touch pads and digital clocks, both of which require a steady stream of=20
power. Part of the reason for the shift was interest in reliability;=20
mechanical switches wear out or need maintenance, whereas electronic contro=
ls=20
are generally service free.
?????Those digital controls are showing up in things such as stoves,=20
dishwashers, washers and dryers, which means these devices also leak=20
electricity even when they're not actually working.
?????Some devices are so badly designed that they generally use as much=20
electricity when they're theoretically off as when they're on, Meier said.=
=20
""The set-top boxes for cable and satellite television broadcasts are good=
=20
examples,"" he said. Manufacturers aren't under any pressure to improve the=
=20
design of electronic components in the home because there's no financial=20
incentive for them to do so.
?????Consumers wind up paying the price.
?????""We think there are typically 20 devices in a home that are consuming=
=20
standby power,"" Meier said. ""In the average home in California, standby pow=
er=20
is somewhere around 500 kilowatt-hours a year. And some users are paying 20=
=20
cents a kilowatt. So that's about $100 a year for appliances that aren't=20
actually doing what you bought them for.""=20
?????That hundred bucks during the course of a year might seem a pretty sma=
ll=20
price to pay for the ability to change the music coming out of the CD playe=
r=20
without having to lever yourself off the couch.
?????But even if it does bother you, there's not a lot you can do, short of=
=20
unplugging devices when they're not in use. Sometimes unplugging a device=
=20
isn't practical, though, because many components will lose information stor=
ed=20
in them if the power goes out. Your radio might forget its presets, your VC=
R=20
will lose the time and some TVs will have to be reprogrammed with the local=
=20
television stations available. ?????On a fundamental level, this is an issu=
e=20
that has to be addressed by electronics manufacturers, who, until now,=20
largely ignored the issue. Meier has been leading a fight during the last=
=20
couple of years to get manufacturers to build devices that use standby powe=
r=20
more efficiently, to keep that functionality but make better use of=20
electricity.
?????""Some of these devices draw 15 or 20 watts,"" Meier said. New designs c=
an=20
reduce that flow to 1 watt, but few manufacturers have shown enthusiasm for=
=20
the goal. That might change as governments put pressure on manufacturers.=
=20
Australia, for one, recently endorsed the goal of 1-watt standby drain for=
=20
all appliances.=20
?????In addition, there is some concern that, under certain conditions,=20
devices that draw power all the time could be slightly more vulnerable to=
=20
damage caused by fluctuations in the power supply than devices that are=20
completely powered down.
?????If that's true, it makes such things as surge suppressors and=20
uninterruptible power supplies even more important to consumers at a time=
=20
when rolling blackouts are expected to become a regular occurrence.
?????Surge suppressors are designed to choke off a spike of electricity=20
before it can reach your valuable components and damage them. Typically, a=
=20
lightning strike a mile or so away can flow down electric, telephone or cab=
le=20
television wires and fry any component connected to the line, such as a hom=
e=20
computer. The surge suppressor intercepts that overload.
?????These surges can occur in many different situations, such as apartment=
=20
buildings where large motors--for instance, those used in air conditioners=
=20
and elevators--routinely go on and off.
?????""Any time the power goes off and goes back on again, that's a tremendo=
us=20
hit on the electrical system, and that can cause surges,"" said John=20
Drengenberg, an electrical engineer who's manager of global consumer affair=
s=20
for Underwriters Laboratories, the nonprofit testing organization. ""I think=
=20
maybe right now in California, in particular, installing transient voltage=
=20
surge suppressors would be a good idea.""
?????Surge suppressors don't help at all with a brownout, which is an=20
insufficient flow of electricity through the wires.
?????Brownouts are most often caused by things such as a squirrel shorting=
=20
out a line and can be identified by suddenly dimmed lights. Low voltage can=
=20
seriously damage appliances that use motors--such as refrigerators and air=
=20
conditioners--so if the lights go dim and stay dim, unplug such appliances=
=20
until the power company makes repairs.
?????Items that use electricity to create heat or produce light will contin=
ue=20
to function with little chance of damage; they just won't get as hot or be =
as=20
bright.
?????Some devices, such as computers, will get trashed by low power or sudd=
en=20
loss of power, especially if the power fluctuates while the system is writi=
ng=20
data to the hard drive. Computers should be turned off using the standard=
=20
shutdown procedure for their particular make and model to avoid corruption =
of=20
the operating system, which can create lots of headaches for users.
?????To avoid that, consider an uninterruptible power supply, basically jus=
t=20
a system of rechargeable batteries that's always plugged in to the electric=
al=20
outlet. Plug the components into the UPS, and if the voltage on the line=20
drops or disappears, the juice flows from the batteries to the device.
?????Many of these systems also come with surge suppressors built in as wel=
l,=20
protecting equipment from both too much and too little electricity. A=20
high-end consumer UPS costs less than $200.
?????Most of these systems are designed to safely power down a computer in=
=20
the event of a power outage. They won't provide enough juice for more than =
a=20
few minutes on a standard desktop computer.
?????And of course, the debate about whether some conservation efforts have=
=20
diminishing returns continues. Turning off your computer reduces electricit=
y=20
consumption, but repeatedly turning the computer off and on can stress the=
=20
electronic circuitry, which could cause it to fail sooner.
?????Devices that are pulling down considerably less electricity might eke=
=20
out an hour or two on a UPS. If you find yourself growing increasingly=20
annoyed at having to reset the clock on the VCR or microwave, a=20
consumer-level UPS might provide enough stored power to get you through a=

blackout that lasts an hour or two.
?????Don't plan on watching TV or making popcorn. We're talking strictly=20
about keeping the clock on line, although most people probably won't be=20

Municipal utilities warned=20

Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis threatened last night to seize excess power=
=20
generated by California's municipal utility districts, which he said have=
=20
charged even higher electricity prices than out-of-state generators.=20
Davis said in an interview with The Chronicle that some municipal utility=
=20
districts have charged the state as much as 10 percent more than the averag=
e=20
wholesale cost demanded by private power companies.=20
The governor's tough talk came as California suffered through a Stage 2 pow=
er=20
alert and faced the prospect of a long, hot summer of rolling blackouts and=
=20
skyrocketing electricity prices. So far this year, the state has paid more=
=20
than $8.2 billion to buy power for its cash-strapped utilities.=20
In a variation on his threat to seize power plants from out-of-state=20
generators if they continue gouging California ratepayers, the governor sai=
d=20
he would use his executive powers to claim excess juice from the locally=20
owned utilities if they do not lower their prices.=20
He said he is ready to go to court if they offer resistance.=20
""We're going to get that power one way or another,"" Davis said.=20
Municipal utilities are city-owned power companies. In Northern California,=
=20
there are municipal utilities in Alameda, Palo Alto, Redding, Sacramento an=
d=20
Santa Clara. Los Angeles has the largest municipal utility in the state.=20
30 DAYS TILL CONTRACT DETAILS=20
For the first time, the governor also gave a time frame for releasing detai=
ls=20
of more than 40 long-term electricity contracts California is signing with=
=20
generators since the financial meltdown of the state's two biggest utilitie=
s.=20
He said that after about six more contracts get nailed down, he expects ful=
l=20
details to be made available within 30 days.=20
Although the contracts involve nearly $40 billion in public funds, Davis an=
d=20
other state officials have adamantly refused to divulge their contents,=20
insisting that secrecy is needed to remain competitive during negotiations.=
=20
The Chronicle and other media outlets have filed suit for access to the=20
contracts, arguing that the public has a right to know how its money is bei=
ng=20
spent.=20
RUDE AWAKENING
While going toe-to-toe with the out-of-state generators, the last thing Dav=
is=20
needed was for municipal utilities -- the home team, as it were -- to emula=
te=20
the Texas big boys and dig deep into California's pockets.=20
Yet the governor's negotiators have been struggling for weeks to convince=
=20
municipals that they are obliged to provide power at cost -- which Davis=20
insisted they are required to do by law.=20
He met last week with the heads of a dozen municipal utilities and told the=
m=20
explicitly that he would not tolerate gouging from within the state as=20
California faces a summer of potential blackouts.=20
The governor said after the meeting that the municipals had agreed ""to make=
=20
most of their excess power available this summer . . . at prices=20
significantly lower than those being charged on the spot market.""=20
Apparently, however, little progress has been made since that declaration.=
=20
Davis told The Chronicle last night that he is still ""trying very hard to=
=20
promote this notion that we're all in this together.""=20
While unwilling to specify which municipal utilities have been most=20
aggressive in their pricing, and refusing to place a dollar amount on how=
=20
much the utilities charged, Davis said he is prepared to seize up to 800=20
megawatts of output if the they do not change their ways.=20
Eight hundred megawatts is enough power to light about 800,000 homes.=20
Representatives of the various municipal utilities could not be reached for=
=20
comment, nor could a spokesperson for the California Municipal Utilities=20
Association in Sacramento.=20
""I told them that they will either (reduce their prices) voluntarily or=20
involuntarily,"" the governor said.=20
UNCERTAIN FUTURE
It remains to be seen, however, whether the municipal utilities will play=
=20
ball. To date, they have shown a firm inclination to go their own way.=20
In March, Lodi's municipal utility district and a Northern California=20
municipal utility cooperative that includes Palo Alto, Santa Clara and=20
Alameda told Pacific Gas and Electric Co. that they will not participate in=
=20
rolling blackouts during power shortages.=20
""I won't arbitrarily screw my customers . . . so 5,000 PG&E customers can=

California's testy relationship with federal energy regulators could turn=

limited price curbs that kicked in this week.=20
In agreeing last month to set flexible caps to restrict price gouging durin=

""A lot of folks were wondering how those two things would interact and are=

Other officials say the federal requirement is premature because no regiona=

Mike Florio, a board member of the California Independent System Operator,=

whether the government would immediately yank the soft price caps that went=

PUC Commissioner Jeff Brown said he would be willing to give up some state=

ZAPLER=20
Mercury News=20

After a year of staunch opposition to a major power plant in South San Jose=
,=20
Mayor Ron Gonzales reversed course Wednesday and endorsed the project,=20
removing the largest remaining barrier to construction and angering residen=
ts=20
of a nearby neighborhood he had pledged to protect.=20
Speaking before news cameras and reporters in his City Hall office, Gonzale=
s=20
said he had negotiated an agreement with Calpine that eased his concerns=20
about the Metcalf Energy Center project. The deal, he said, contains=20
provisions to help shield the Santa Teresa neighborhood from air pollution,=
=20
gives local businesses the chance to negotiate below-market electricity rat=
es=20
and provides a sure energy source for local residents.=20
``We need power in San Jose and we believe this power plant is needed in Sa=
n=20
Jose,'' Gonzales said. ``We've worked hard to make this plant better for th=
e=20
neighborhoods and better for the city.''=20
But the city entered talks with Calpine about five weeks ago in a vastly=20
weakened position, and its chief negotiator, mayoral budget director Joe=20
Guerra, was unable to extract most of the concessions the city and=20
neighborhood had sought. Santa Teresa leader Elizabeth Cord called the=20
neighborhood protection provisions ``totally not substantive,'' and another=
=20
opponent said a lawsuit is likely if the plant is ultimately approved.=20
``The mayor's deal does nothing to reduce the impact on this neighborhood,'=
'=20
Santa Teresa activist Issa Ajlouny said. ``It's the same project as it was=
=20
two years ago except San Jose residents will be paying millions of dollars=
=20
more.''=20
Shift by Cisco?=20
Cisco Systems, which is planning a 20,000-worker campus adjacent to the=20
proposed plant and has strenuously opposed it, appears to be softening its=
=20
opposition. Kent Jenkins Jr., a spokesman for the company, said Wednesday=
=20
that Cisco would still prefer not to have the plant, but that officials wer=
e=20
pleased, at first glance, with the health and safety concessions Gonzales h=
ad=20
negotiated. Asked whether Cisco might file a lawsuit, Jenkins said, ``We're=
=20
not ruling anything in or out and by that, I don't want to imply we are=20
considering anything.''=20
He added that the agreement will have no bearing on the company's plans to=
=20
build the campus. ``All along we were committed to pursuing Coyote Valley a=
nd=20
that remains unchanged,'' he said.=20
With experts predicting a summer of rolling blackouts, and with the=20
California Energy Commission expected soon to override the city council's=
=20
November rejection of the plant, Gonzales was under enormous pressure to=20
strike a deal. Polls taken by Calpine had shown overwhelming public support=
=20
for the plant, another ominous sign for the mayor who is up for re-election=
=20
next year.=20
While the city probably could not have blocked approval of the plant once i=
t=20
got state approval, the mayor indicated as late as April?18 that the city=
=20
might fight it in court. But that possibility vanished with Wednesday's=20
announcement, leaving a possible neighborhood-backed lawsuit as the only=20
potential threat.=20
``This power plant is coming to San Jose. That's clear from the support it=
=20
has gathered in Sacramento,'' Gonzales conceded, referring to Gov. Gray=20
Davis' endorsement in April. So rather than continue to fight an uphill=20
battle, Gonzales decided it was best to negotiate what he could.=20
At the news conference, Gonzales touted provisions in the deal that will=20
provide two additional air monitoring stations to ensure the plant complies=
=20
with local air quality standards. The agreement also provides a three-month=
=20
window, prior to the plant's opening, for San Jose businesses to negotiate=
=20
long-term power contracts with the Metcalf plant at a ``below-market'' rate=
,=20
said Calpine chief executive officer Peter Cartwright.=20
City's concessions=20
But the city clearly got less than it wanted, which was at least partly the=
=20
price of Gonzales' longtime resistance to the 600-megawatt plant:=20
?One key negotiating point was how much Calpine would pay to extend a=20
recycled-water pipeline seven miles to the plant site. The city started by=
=20
asking the company to pay at least $25 million of the roughly $50 million=
=20
price tag. But, in a provision Gonzales touted as a victory, Calpine will p=
ay=20
20 percent of the cost, or $10 million, and the city will pick up the=20
remaining $40 million. Calpine said the company is simply paying its fair=
=20
share.=20
?In an effort to protect neighborhoods from pollution, the city wanted=20
Metcalf to operate full time, since emissions are highest when a power plan=
t=20
first fires up. The city tried to arrange a long-term contract with the sta=
te=20
to buy power from Metcalf to keep it running constantly, but officials balk=
ed=20
at such a commitment.=20
Calpine said it intends to keep the plant running constantly as long as=20

f=20

generator will start up by 25 percent, from 624 per year to 468 annually.=
=20
That restriction would last five years, by which time the energy crisis in=

?In the fall, Calpine offered $10 million in electricity discounts to help=

In his op-ed piece, Davis cited an estimate that the size of California's=

Defending his own methods of dealing with the power crisis, which has cause=

``The threat is real,'' Davis wrote, ``and the Bush administration must ado=

It's been fine with almost everybody else outside the immediate neighborhoo=

since the plant was proposed by Calpine and Bechtel more than a year ago. I=

escalated from fine to urgent as the shortage of electricity pushed prices=

into the clouds and led to blackouts.=20
In the process, the opposition of Gonzales and the San Jose City Council, o=

in favor of the 600-megawatt plant, enough to serve 600,000 homes.=20
The Legislature and Gov. Gray Davis wondered what San Jose could be thinkin=

The California Energy Commission has the last word on power plant siting=20
regardless of the city's position. Denial would be flabbergasting.=20
Wednesday afternoon, Gonzales yielded gracefully; Calpine, along with its=

Calpine will add two stations to monitor air quality, reduce the number of=

These are not trivial additions to the original proposal. But Calpine/Becht=

held all the cards. Almost certainly, it could have jammed the plant throug=

without sweeteners.=20
Instead, both parties recognized that Calpine and the city must do business=

together for the plant to work well. Calpine depends, for instance, on=20
recycled water from the city's sewage treatment plant. And the city needs=

customers like Calpine, which will consume 3 million gallons a day, to use =

that water.=20
It's a mutually beneficial arrangement, just as it was from the start.

Building a new plant? More power to them=20
May 31, 2001=20
By GORDON DILLOW
Orange=20
County Register=20
As you probably know, the main reason we're in a power crisis in California=
=20
is because we haven't built enough power-generating plants. And one reason =
we=20
haven't built enough plants is NIMBY-ism: When faced with having a new powe=
r=20
plant nearby, most people shout ""Not in my back yard!""=20
Well, I just found out that a new power plant is being built in my back yar=
d.=20
And frankly, I think it's a dandy idea.=20
The power plant in question is being built at the county Olinda Alpha=20
Landfill in Brea. The plan is to take the methane gas formed by the natural=
=20
decomposition of refuse in the dump - which ordinarily would have to be=20
flared off -- and burn it in engines to produce electricity. Actually,=20
they've been producing power at the landfill that way for years, but now,=
=20
with power at a premium, a New Jersey-based company called Ridgewood Power=
=20
wants to expand the plant's output by about 50 percent.=20
True, the power plant isn't literally in my back yard; it's a couple of=20
ridgelines away. But it's still close enough for the Air Quality Management=
=20
District to recently send me a letter informing me of increased pollution=
=20
from the plant - and warning me that the plant emissions could cause cancer=
.=20
Now, ordinarily those would be the sort of grim tidings that would cause=20
palpitations in my homeowner's heart. So why am I being so welcoming to my=
=20
new power-generating, air-polluting neighbor?=20
Several reasons. First, it's a pretty tiny power plant. Even with the 50=20
percent production boost, it will only crank out 8 megawatts - enough to=20
provide power to about 8,000 homes, but still less than 1 percent of the=20
juice produced by one reactor at the San Onofre nuclear power plant.=20
Also, the increased air pollution hardly seems like enough to worry about.=
=20
For example, the AQMD says the plant will produce up to 9 pounds of fine=20
particulates per day - which is probably about the same amount of=20
particulates I release into the atmosphere when I burn a steak on the=20
barbecue. And according to the AQMD's calculations, I'd have to suck in the=
=20
plant's air for 70 years to run even a 1-in-1 million risk of developing=20
cancer from the emissions.=20
But the big thing in favor of the landfill power plant is that it's exactly=
=20
the sort of clever power-producing scheme we need right now. It takes=20
something we don't need - the methane from our garbage - and turns it into=
=20
something we desperately need: electric power. These days, every 8 megawatt=
s=20
helps.=20
And now that I think on it, there's another, more personal advantage to=20
having the landfill power plant nearby:=20
Without requiring any real sacrifices on my part, it makes me feel like a=
=20
non-NIMBYist. So when they start looking around for a place to build anothe=
r=20
power plant to help ease the energy crunch, I can strongly suggest - no,=20
demand! -- that they build it in somebody else's back yard.=20
Because I already have one in mine.

The Orange County Register=20
SACRAMENTO Gov. Gray Davis has until Friday to decide whether to place=20
California's 28,000 miles of electricity lines under increased federal=20
control by joining other Western states in a regional power grid.=20
The decision, which has provoked little public discussion, has long-term=20
implications for the way the state will be able to control its electricity.=
=20
Federal energy regulators believe creating about 18 huge multistate grids=
=20
across the United States - known as regional transmission organizations, or=
=20
RTOs - will make it easier to speed electricity across the country. That wi=
ll=20
limit outages and lower prices for consumers, according to the Federal Ener=
gy=20
Regulatory Commission.=20
Critics of deregulation, however, contend the creation of an RTO in effect=
=20
turns over the state's lines to the Bush administration, which has close ti=
es=20
to power companies that have profited mightily in California.=20
""The whole (FERC) plan is to federalize the transmission lines and federali=
ze=20
energy policy, and to get the biggest state to commit to this scheme, (whic=
h)=20
would be a huge boost for Bush and his allies,"" said San Diego energy=20
consumer advocate Michael Shames.=20
The RTOs would have the authority to levy transmission charges on wholesale=

throughout the grids. The FERC wants the RTOs up and running by December.=

would participate.=20
Davis, although not directly deciding the issue, wields influence over the=

of the utilities. The reports to FERC are expected to largely reflect his=
=20
will.=20
Missing Friday's deadline could cause the Bush administration to halt the=
=20
so-called ""soft cap"" price controls currently on California's roiling=20
electricity market. But the threat that holds little worry for Davis.=20
Last month, FERC decided to set targets for power prices when state=20
electricity reserves fall to 7.5 percent or lower during Stage 1, 2 or 3=20
power alerts. Davis and others complained that the targets were ""soft caps""=
=20
that could easily be ignored by power companies.=20
Stanford University energy economist Frank Wolak suggested that California=
=20
should refuse to join an existing RTO, but devise its own plan and present =
it=20
to FERC. Others agree, saying such a huge state could be a single-state RTO=

Electrical Emergency Stepped Up to Stage Two; Need for Energy Conservation =
is=20
Critical



FOLSOM, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 30, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -
The California
Independent System Operator (California ISO) declared a Stage Two
Electrical Emergency today, Wednesday, May 30, 2001, at 2:00 p.m. with
operating reserves dipping below five percent. A number of factors are
contributing to today's emergency condition:
--  With higher than expected temperatures and the corresponding use


of air conditioning units, the demand for power is trending


approximately 1,200 megawatts over the forecast.
--  Net imports are running at 4,000 megawatts; 3,000 less than last


week.
--  A total of 9,800 megawatts worth of generation remains unavailable


today with power plants off-line because of preventative repairs


and plant malfunctions.


Consumers are asked to step up conservation efforts as the
California ISO's job of balancing the supply and demand for power
becomes more challenging this afternoon and into the evening peak
hours. Demand across the California ISO Control Area is expected to
peak at 36,174 megawatts around 3:00 p.m. this afternoon. Today's
Stage Two Emergency is in effect until midnight. With the Stage Two
declaration, the California ISO is able to access emergency resources
that will help maintain operating reserves.


A Stage Two Emergency is declared when operating reserves dip
below five percent or are expected to within the next two hours. If an
operating reserve shortfall of less than one-and-a-half percent is
unavoidable, Stage Three will be initiated. Involuntary curtailments
of service to customers, including ""rotating blackouts,"" are possible
during this emergency declaration.


The California ISO is charged with managing the flow of
electricity along the long-distance, high-voltage power lines that
make up the bulk of California's transmission system. The
not-for-profit public-benefit corporation assumed the responsibility
in March, 1998, when California opened its energy markets to
competition and the state's investor-owned utilities turned their
private transmission power lines over to the California ISO to manage.
The mission of the California ISO is to safeguard the reliable
delivery of electricity, facilitate markets and ensure equal access to
a 25,526 circuit mile ""electron highway.""


Information about the California ISO control area's electricity
supply and the current demand is available on the web at
www.caiso.com.

Washington's Role Helped Spark California's Power Crunch



WASHINGTON, May 29, 2001 (States News Service via COMTEX)  via NewsEdge=20
Corporation  - Although it is
popular in Washington to point the finger at California for its energy cris=
is,
the federal government shares a good deal of blame for the California energ=
y
crisis.

In 1995, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission helped lay the foundation=
=20
for
what has become the debacle of the new millenium when it rejected a state p=
lan
calling for new power plants that today would be providing 1,300 megawatts =
in
new electricity.


What's more, records from that year show that the regulatory commission
expressed ""grave concerns about the need"" for new power generation in the=
=20
state.


Had those power plants been built, they would be generating power for an
estimated 1.3 million homes at the wholesale fixed cost of between 3.5 and =
6.6
cents per kilowatt-hour with binding, long-term contracts.


At the time, retail prices averaged 9 cents per kilowatt-hour, according to=
=20
FERC
documents.


In recent months, wholesale prices have been averaging between 12 cents to =
13
cents per kilowatt-hour, according to California Public Utility Commission
spokesman James Hendry. During peak usage, those prices can reach 20 cents =
to=20
40
cents and at times have rocketed to a record $1.90 since last December.


""Everybody is saying those prices will go higher this summer,"" Hendry added=
.


Nevertheless, members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission -- known =
as
FERC -- have regularly blamed California for failing to build new power pla=
nts
to meet present power needs that have sparked energy shortages and higher=
=20
prices
throughout the West.


The commission also shares the widely held view that faulty legislation aim=
ed=20
at
deregulating the state's power industry in 1996 is to blame.


Although FERC put limited price caps into effect on wholesale electricity o=
n
Tuesday, the commission continues to resist broader demands to stabilize=20
prices
in the Western region, as has been sought by California Gov. Gray Davis, an=
d
other lawmakers. They claim that FERC has ignored their responsibility to=
=20
ensure
that electricity rates are ""just and fair.""


President Bush has sided with FERC's limited price caps because he believes=
=20
that
market-oriented supply and demand is the only sure way to restore permanent
order to the crisis.


The messy trail of the Golden State's rolling blackouts and power failures
passed through Washington in January 1995 when several California utility
companies asked FERC to rule against the state's plans to build power=20
facilities
around the state.


As part of that plan, first announced in 1992, the California Public Utilit=
ies
Commission nailed down bids through a competitive auction process to build =
two
new geothermal plants, one wind farm, and the repowering of an existing ste=
am
plant in Southern California. A ""badly needed"" gas-powered plant on the San
Francisco Peninsula also was called for.


All would have been up and running by 1999.


Had the plants been build, California's electrical utilities would have bee=
n
required to buy power from them under a long-standing policy first enacted =
by
Congress in 1978, the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act. But two utili=
ty
companies protested, claiming they didn't need more electricity. Besides, t=
hey
said they could provide or purchase cheaper electricity elsewhere if needed=
.


California used ""a flawed auction process,"" recalled Art Larson, spokesman =
for
Sempra Energy, parent company of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, when asked=
=20
about the
decision. ""It didn't consider the least-cost bids,"" he said, because=20
California
mandated the use of renewable energy.


So, just two months before construction on the plants was to begin, Souther=
n
California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric filed a protest with FER=
C.=20
The
five-member regulatory commission approves rates for wholesale electric sal=
es=20
of
electricity and transmission in interstate commerce.


Both utility companies argued that because the PUC favored renewable energy
generation, it ignored less expensive ways to provide electricity such as
gas-fired plants and other sources.


Southern California Edison also expressed concerns about California's effor=
ts=20
to
deregulate the electric utility industry that soon would be approved the
following year. Such legislation would likely bring down energy costs, it
predicted.


Other parties also weighed in on the complaint, including the National Coal=
=20
and
Western Fuels Association, which claimed that Edison could purchase power f=
rom
out-of-state sources at 3 cents a kilowatt hour. Today, FERC and other crit=
ics
of California's electricity policies believe that the state relies far too
heavily on out-of-state sources.


California responded to the complaints by noting that it did approve gas=20
powered
turbines in its plans, but also wanted ""clean"" energy suppliers as part of =
the
state's environmental objectives. After factoring in the costs of controlli=
ng
pollution in California caused by other forms of energy production, the pri=
ce
for electricity provided from alternative sources would be competitive, it=
=20
said.


California's argument fell of deaf ears and FERC sided with the utility
companies. In its ruling, the commission stated that California's auction
procedure violated the standards set by PURPA because the state explicitly
sought out renewable energy providers and ignored other sources in the bidd=
ing
process.


FERC added that ""we have grave concerns about the need"" for added electrici=
ty=20
in
California. It also cautioned that the fact that the state was moving towar=
d
deregulating the electricity industry, ""heightens our concern"" about forcin=
g
utility companies into long-term contracts.


FERC's controversial ruling, which was opposed by many independent energy
organizations, still disturbs Loretta Lynch, chairman of the California Pub=
lic
Utilities Commission.


What derailed the effort to build more power ""was not the actions of=20
California,
but instead the actions of FERC itself,"" she said last December when FERC=
=20
first
denied requests to place wholesale price caps on electricity in western sta=
tes
and blamed California for not building enough power plants.


And how do the utility companies now feel about the power plants they fough=
t=20
in
1995 when long-term contracts would have been had for a fraction of the cos=
t
they are now paying?


""20/20 hindsight is a luxury,"" responds Larson of Sempra Energy. ""But the=
=20
prices
were out of line in the 1990s.""

Energy Experts Say Solution to California Crisis is Inescapable/ Build More=
=20
Power Plants and Ensure Competition



ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 30, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -
As the Bush Administration
continues to face harsh criticism in California over perceived
inaction regarding the energy crisis, industry executives appear to be
lining up behind Bush's assertion that enhancing the availability and
reliability of the nation's energy supply is the long-term solution.


And they consider creating more supply while maintaining the
transition to a deregulated marketplace crucial, reports the May issue
of Energy Competition Strategy Report, published by Atlanta-based NHI
Publications.


One leading utility executive says the solution to the nation's
long-term supply problem is inescapable. ""We need to build new power
plants. And those new plants will be built only if we allow the
competitive market to do its job,"" says William Hecht, chairman,
president, and CEO of Allentown, PA-based PPL Corp. Price caps - which
California is pushing for and Bush opposes - ""reduce the incentive to
invest in new production and unnecessarily prolong and exacerbate the
current supply and demand mismatch,"" Hecht adds.


PPL is aggressively developing new power plants in Connecticut,
New York, Pennsylvania, Washington, and Arizona that will add more
than 4,000 megawatts of supply. Other members of the Washington,
DC-based Electric Power Supply Association, such as ABB Energy
Ventures of Switzerland and Zeigler Coal Holding of Ashland, KY, are
building new, unregulated merchant power plants.


Meanwhile, EPSA is asking Congress to enact legislation that would
allow federal eminent domain for transmission siting and establish a
standardized interconnection policy to make it easier for generation
companies to ""get onto the grid.""

''Believe me, we're not proud,'' said Mr. Keller, who said he had appealed=

warnings of blackouts. ''We'll do what we have to to protect our=20

The energy crisis here has come to this: from tourist attractions in sunny=

Southern California, to farmers who dominate the central region of the stat=
e,=20
to technology concerns up north, businesses are coming up with novel ways t=
o=20
cope with what many fear will be an unpleasant summer.=20
The concerns are understandable given the issues that many businesses face,=
=20
including lost revenue and potential layoffs, as the state's power shortage=
s=20
continue. ''The uncertainty is what kills you,'' Jerry Meek, utility=20
operations manager at Roche Pharmaceuticals in Palo Alto, said.=20
Trying to reduce that uncertainty, businesses are applying to the state's=
=20
Public Utilities Commission for exemptions from having their power turned o=
ff=20
this summer. (The deadline is Friday.) Last week, Gov. Gray Davis announced=
=20
that the state would begin a three-tiered warning system for residences and=
=20
businesses that are likely to be affected. The first warning will come two=
=20
days before a blackout; the second, one day in advance; and the final=20
warning, one hour before the lights go out.=20
A more radical approach is being suggested by Mike Briggs, a Republican=20
assemblyman from Fresno. He is asking the state to schedule potential=20
blackout days as much as months in advance so business owners know when the=
ir=20

this gives people options.''=20
Farmers in the Central Valley, for instance, have to order water for their=
=20
crops a day ahead. But if the power is off when the water shows up in an=20
irrigation canal, he said, ''they can't open the gates and the water flows=
=20
right past them.'' One business owner told Mr. Briggs that he spent $30,000=

one month to lease two generators that were never used. ''He said it would=

Of course critics worry that burglars will know when the lights go out, too=

''But maybe people are willing to make that trade-off.''=20
Even those business owners who say they are currently protected from power=

amusement park in Carlsbad, near San Diego, has an arrangement with its=20

a spokeswoman, Courtney Simmons. Still, she added, the park is prepared in=

the event of a loss.=20
The contingency plan consists of keeping open the 3 rides, of the 20 total,=

that are not powered by electricity, she said. Barbecues would be rolled ou=
t=20
to cook food, and the park's boulevards would be flooded with performers,=
=20
including singers, dancers, jugglers and musicians who will entertain until=
=20
the power comes back on. ''We are prepared for outages no matter what the=
=20
cause this summer,'' she said.=20
Many tourist attractions, including Disneyland in Anaheim, are already=20
prepared because they upgraded their systems in 1999, fearing a Year 2000=
=20
disaster that would threaten the power grid. ''A lot of these things were=
=20
already tested and documented,'' said Ray Gomez, director of communications=
=20
at Disneyland Resorts. ''We are skilled at emergency evacuations. Energy is=
=20
only one part of that.''=20
As part of its plan, Disneyland shored up its emergency operations center,=
=20
holding employee drills to turn on emergency power. This summer, Disneyland=
=20
will have employee volunteers who roam the park day and night, turning out=
=20
lights and replacing incandescent bulbs with more energy-efficient ones. Th=
e=20
park also works with the city of Anaheim, which supplies the park with powe=
r,=20
to conserve 5 to 10 percent, minimizing the risk of blackouts at all.=20
Oddly enough, Disneyland is reviving its Main Street Electrical Parade, a=

29-year-old light show that had most recently been an attraction in Florida=
.=20
Leslie Goodman, a senior vice president for strategic communications for Wa=

Disney Parks and Resorts, said the park had made sure that the parade did n=

despite what was a difficult decision and a potential public relations=20

While most businesses make an effort to conserve (if for no other reason th=

incentives. The city of Palo Alto, for example, has agreed not to cut off=
=20
power to Roche Pharmaceuticals as long as the company reduces energy=20
consumption by 15 percent within 30 minutes of an announced Stage 3 alert,=
=20
the state's most critical. Only once has Roche lost power, said Mr. Meek, t=
he=20
company's utility operations manager. And that, he added, was because of a=
=20
mistake.=20
Roche has a plan to ensure that a blackout does not happen. Once Mr. Meek=

gets an alert on his pager from a city representative (who can see how much=

es=20
asking them to turn off nonessential lights. The air-conditioning is change=
d=20
to raise the temperature in most areas to 78 degrees from a normal 72=20
degrees. Lighting in all offices is reduced, and some employees move from=
=20
their dark cubicles to the window-walled cafeteria to work, he said.=20
''The question is, do you treasure light or do you want your computer shut=

down?'' Mr. Meek asked. If these measures do not reduce overall demand by 1=

percent, Roche will switch on backup generators to power the laboratories.=
=20
Why? If laboratory tools are not properly shut off before a loss of power, =

takes days to recalibrate them, costing thousands of dollars and wasted tim=
e,=20
Mr. Meek said. ''My focus with the uncertainty is to do what we can to get=

One way that California businesses are seeking certainty is by appealing to=

the state's Public Utilities Commission for relief. One commissioner, Carl=

Dan Walters: Record undercuts governor's message on handling energy crisis


(Published June 11, 2001)=20
Gov. Gray Davis spoke to a small business conference in Sacramento on May 3=
0=20
and reminded attendees that ""I'm a pro-business Democrat."" He then launched=
=20
into a recitation of his standard pitch on the state's energy crisis -- tha=
t=20
it's being caused by ""greedy energy companies"" and that he's working hard t=
o=20
solve it with far-reaching conservation programs and a massive power plant=
=20
construction program.=20
""For 12 years, California did not build one major power plant,"" he said,=20
adding that since he became governor, 15 have been approved, 10 are under=
=20
construction, and by 2003 ""we will have more capacity than demand.""=20
Davis is a politician who's renowned for staying, in the jargon of politica=
l=20
consultants, ""on message."" And what he told the business conference about=
=20
building power plants replicated what he had said dozens of times in=20
preceding weeks. During his April 5 televised speech on the crisis, for=20
example, Davis claimed, ""In the 12 years before I took office, not a single=
=20
major power plant was built in California. Not one.""=20
Clearly, Davis' message to Californians is that the state wasn't building=
=20
power plants before he began his governorship in January 1999, but that he =
is=20
moving, as he often says, ""at warp speed"" to license and build new plants a=
nd=20
close the supply-demand gap. There are two things wrong with that message:=
=20
His account of the pre-Davis record is not accurate, and his assertion that=
=20
huge amounts of new power generation are coming soon is, to say the least,=
=20
questionable.=20
First, the past. In the 12 years prior to his becoming governor, the=20
California Energy Commission licensed 17 power plants with a generating=20
capacity of about 1,900 megawatts. Twenty-one plants totaling 3,100 megawat=
ts=20
began producing power during the period, including two considered ""major"" b=
y=20
the usual definition of being 300 megawatts or more: the 300-megawatt=20
Sycamore plant in Kern County and the 385-megawatt Watson cogeneration plan=
t=20
in Los Angeles County. Two more plants that started production during the=
=20
period were more than 200 megawatts.=20
After Davis became governor, but while the Energy Commission was still=20
controlled by appointees of his predecessor, Pete Wilson, the commission=20
licensed an additional 5,800 megawatts of generation, including nine major=
=20
plants.=20
Plant licensing has been speeded up in the last six months, but the total o=
f=20
plants licensed by the Davis-controlled commission is less than 4,000=20
megawatts and none of those facilities has gone into production.=20
New plants are under construction, according to progress reports prepared b=
y=20
the Energy Commission, but wheth- er all the recently licensed facilities=
=20
will be built, at least in the near future, is questionable. There is, powe=
r=20
industry sources say, an increasing reluctance by energy companies to commi=
t=20
hundreds of millions of dollars to con- struct licensed plants (about=20
$750,000 per megawatt for new facilities) while Davis continues to denounce=
=20
them as greedy exploiters and hints he may seize plants under an emergency=
=20
declaration. Another factor is uncertainty over whether the state or=20
utilities will be financially able to buy the power.=20
One hint of that attitude has already surfaced publicly. Mirant Corp.=20
announced June 1 that it was delaying construction of a 530-megawatt=20
expansion of its Contra Costa County generation complex ""because of=20
uncertainty about California energy market rules."" Randy Harrison, head of=
=20
Mirant's Western operations, said, ""We have to be able to determine that th=
is=20
will be a viable investment before we can put a quarter of a billion dollar=
s'=20
worth of steel on the ground.""=20
Work on much smaller cogeneration and ""peaker"" plants has begun, but many o=
f=20
the big ones apparently are being put on hold. Indeed, there's a secondary=
=20
market developing for selling licensed projects that could be built in the=

future. Energy executives may be greedy, but they're not stupid and it woul=

CalPeak, impatient with the city's permit process, opted to bypass the city=

Hackers Victimize Cal-ISO=20

By DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writer=20

?????SACRAMENTO--For at least 17 days at the height of the energy crisis,=
=20
hackers mounted an attack on a computer system that is integral to the=20
movement of electricity throughout California, a confidential report obtain=
ed=20
by The Times shows.
?????The hackers' success, though apparently limited, brought to light laps=
es=20
in computer security at the target of the cyber-attack, the California=20
Independent System Operator, which oversees most of the state's massive=20
electricity transmission grid.
?????Officials at Cal-ISO say that the lapses have been corrected and that=
=20
there was no threat to the grid. But others familiar with the attack say=20
hackers came close to gaining access to key parts of the system, and could=
=20
have seriously disrupted the movement of electricity across the state.
?????Democratic and Republican lawmakers were angered by the security breac=
h=20
at an entity that is such a basic part of California's power system, given=
=20
its fragility during the state's continuing energy crisis. One called the=
=20
attack ""ominous.""
?????An internal agency report, stamped ""restricted,"" shows that the attack=
=20
began as early as April 25 and was not detected until May 11. The report sa=
ys=20
the main attack was routed through China Telecom from someone in Guangdong=
=20
province in China.
?????In addition to using China Telecom, hackers entered the system by usin=
g=20
Internet servers based in Santa Clara in Northern California and Tulsa,=20
Okla., the report says. James Sample, the computer security specialist at=
=20
Cal-ISO who wrote the report, said he could not tell for certain where the=
=20
attackers were located.
?????""You don't know where people are really from,"" Sample said. ""The only=
=20
reason China stuck out is because of the recent political agenda China had=
=20
with the U.S. . . . An ambitious U.S. hacker could have posed as a Chinese=
=20
hacker.""
?????The breach occurred amid heightened Sino-American tensions after the=
=20
collision between a Chinese military jet and a U.S. spy plane. In early May=
,=20
there were hundreds of publicly reported computer attacks apparently=20
originating from China. Most of those incidents involved mischief;=20
anti-American slogans were scrawled on government Web sites.
?????The attack on the Cal-ISO computer system apparently had the potential=
=20
for more serious consequences, given that the hackers managed to worm their=
=20
way into the computers at the agency's headquarters in Folsom, east of=20
Sacramento, that were linked to a system that controls the flow of=20
electricity across California. The state system is tied into the transmissi=
on=20
grid for the Western United States.
?????""This was very close to being a catastrophic breach,"" said a source=20
familiar with the attack and CalISO's internal investigation of the inciden=
t.
?????On May 7 and 8, as the infiltration was occurring, California suffered=
=20
widespread rolling blackouts, but Cal-ISO officials said Friday that there=
=20
was no connection between the hacking and the outages, which affected more=
=20
than 400,000 utility customers.
?????""It did not affect markets or reliability,"" said Stephanie McCorkle, a=
=20
spokeswoman for Cal-ISO.
?????Officials of the agency made no public acknowledgment of the attack=20
until Friday when contacted by The Times. The agency did, however, call the=
=20
FBI, which is investigating.
?????McCorkle said Cal-ISO did not make a public disclosure about the hacki=
ng=20
""because it didn't impact the reliability of any of our internal networks.""
?????""It didn't have a negative consequence and would not have impacted the=
=20
public or market participants,"" McCorkle said.
?????After the attack was discovered, the report says, investigators found=
=20
evidence that the hackers apparently were trying to ""compile"" or write=20
software that might have allowed them to get past so-called firewalls=20
protecting far more sensitive parts of the computer system.
?????The attackers focused on parts of the grid agency's computer system th=
at=20
are under development. In what may have been the most significant lapse, th=
e=20
system being developed was not behind a firewall, a security element design=
ed=20
to keep out those who are not entitled to access.
?????Additionally, so-called tripwires that might have alerted agency=20
security personnel to the unauthorized entry were nonexistent. Nor were the=
re=20
logs within the system that might have identified users entering the system=
=20
as the infiltration was occurring, the report notes.
?????What's more, dozens of ports into the computer system were open, when=
=20
only a handful should have been available.
?????""All servers should be hardened regardless of their role or location i=
n=20
the network,"" the report says. ""Only ports that are required to be open=20
should be opened; all others should be disabled.""
?????Complicating the investigation, workers at Cal-ISO rebooted their=20
computers when the machines balked, apparently in response to the=20
infiltration.
?????""This action limited our ability to discover all files and activity th=
at=20
may be related to this compromise,"" the report says.
?????Sample, the security engineer who wrote the report, downplayed the=20
potential threat and said the attack was ""something that we've been=20
anticipating.""
?????""It was a compromise, not really an attack,"" he said.
?????State legislators were not comforted by such distinctions.
?????""That's really amazing on two counts: that there were computers not=20
behind a firewall and it took 17 days to discover,"" said state Sen. Debra=
=20
Bowen (D-Marina del Rey), who chairs her chamber's Energy Committee.
?????Bowen, who was informed of the breach by The Times, called it a ""serio=
us=20
matter"" and said she was ""very concerned to learn about this from the L.A.=
=20
Times, rather than from the ISO itself."" The lack of official notification,=
=20
she said, adds to her skepticism about whether the agency has been=20
forthcoming.
?????""It is embarrassing, so I can understand they would not want to talk=
=20
about it,"" Bowen said. ""We're going to ask some questions.""
?????The Independent System Operator, established in 1998 when the state=20
opened the newly deregulated electricity market to competition, is an=20
essential component of the state's electricity system.
?????The purpose of the nonprofit entity is to balance the flow of=20
electricity across the state and make last-minute power purchases to match=
=20
demand and avoid blackouts. The Legislature reconfigured the agency earlier=
=20
this year, giving Gov. Gray Davis the power to appoint the five-member boar=
d=20
that oversees it.
?????""It is troubling that it happened,"" said Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousa=
nd=20
Oaks). ""It is disturbing that it took so long to be corrected. And it is=20
galling that it was not reported to the Legislature.""
?????McClintock labeled as ""ominous"" the possibility that the attack came=
=20
from China. He said he is preparing a request for all documents related to=
=20
the breach and is considering requesting a formal legislative inquiry.
?????ISO board member Mike Florio, who represents consumers, said he had a=

Drop in Gas Price Raises Questions in Probe=20
Regulation: Cost has fallen 96% since May 31, stirring accusations of an=20
artificial shortage.=20

By RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR, Times Staff Writer=20

?????WASHINGTON--As the price of natural gas destined for California power=
=20
plants continued to collapse Friday, new questions were being raised about =
a=20
controversial shipping deal between two offshoots of a Texas energy=20
conglomerate.
?????State officials and utilities have complained to the Federal Energy=20
Regulatory Commission that subsidiaries of Houston-based El Paso Corp.=20
restricted gas supplies on a major pipeline system last year, creating an=
=20
artificial shortage that sent energy costs soaring. The company has=20
steadfastly denied the allegations, which are the focus of a trial-like=20
hearing stretching into its fifth week at FERC.
?????But in a development that had the courtroom abuzz Friday, the markup f=
or=20
natural gas shipped from producing basins in Texas to the Southern Californ=
ia=20
border has plunged by 96% since May 31, when the contract between the El Pa=
so=20
subsidiaries expired and about 30 competitors entered the market.
?????According to data from Natural Gas Week, the markup between Texas and =
a=20
major California-border pipeline junction served by El Paso fell from $6.32=
=20
per million British thermal units on May 31--the last day of the=20
controversial deal--to only 23 cents Friday. A million BTU is about what a=
=20
typical Southern California household consumes in five or six days.
?????That put Southern California natural gas prices in line with the rest =
of=20
the country for the first time since last July.=20
?????State officials and California utilities said the price collapse=20
bolstered their case that the El Paso companies had been exercising market=
=20
power--engaging in monopolistic behavior.
?????""You can't help but think that the market is reacting to the differenc=
e=20
between having many shippers instead of one,"" said Kevin Lipson, a lawyer=
=20
representing Southern California Edison in the proceedings against El Paso.=
=20
""The market knows the difference between competition and monopoly.""
?????Under the deal that just expired, one subsidiary of El Paso had obtain=
ed=20
the shipping rights for up to 17% of California's daily gas consumption=20
through a pipeline system owned by another subsidiary.
?????""We don't have an 800-pound gorilla any more,"" said Harvey Morris, a=
=20
lawyer for the California Public Utilities Commission. ""We have a chimpanze=
e.""
?????But Peggy Heeg, deputy general counsel for El Paso Corp., said other=
=20
factors--such as mild weather and increased storage levels of gas in=20
California--are behind the dramatic price swing.
?????""We are glad to see prices coming down and to see some relief for=20
Californians,"" Heeg said. ""The price movement is consistent with what we ar=
e=20
saying, which is that supply and demand are driving prices.""
?????The swift reversal in prices has raised suspicions at FERC.
?????""It's not enough to convict El Paso and send them to jail, but this=20
piece of information is certainly consistent with the idea that there was=
=20
market power,"" said an agency official.
?????""Prices had been dropping a little, but since June 1, it's become very=
=20
noticeable,"" said another agency official. ""Obviously, one of the reasons h=
as=20
to be that the capacity changed hands.""
?????FERC's governing board can order El Paso to refund profits if it finds=
=20
that the subsidiaries tried to manipulate the California market.
?????One independent economist cautioned against a rush to judgment. ""There=
=20
are a lot of things going on which in and of themselves could account for a=
=20
significant price decline,"" said Bruce Henning of Energy and Environmental=
=20
Analysis Inc. in Arlington, Va. ""I would be unwilling to draw a causal link=
.""
?????In addition to the weather and fuller storage cited by El Paso's Heeg,=
=20
increased conservation by Californians has reduced demand for electricity.=
=20
That, in turn, has dampened the market for natural gas, the fuel most=20
commonly used by the state's power plants.
?????But the industry also has come under strong political pressure in rece=
nt=20
weeks. In hearings before Congress and the California Legislature, lawmaker=
s=20
spoke out against natural gas prices that were much higher than elsewhere i=
n=20
the nation. California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer launched an investigation. A=
nd=20
FERC, in addition to the El Paso hearing, called an industry conference.
?????Plaintiffs' lawyers in the El Paso case say they believe the pressure=

led El Paso Merchant Energy--which sells natural gas--to pass up an option =
to=20
renew its contract with El Paso Natural Gas Co., which owns the pipeline=20
system. Instead, El Paso Merchant settled for a much smaller chunk of=20
capacity on its sister company's system. El Paso says the decision was made=

for business reasons, not in response to pressure from regulators.

New Power Plant Proposed for Riverside County

By MITCHELL LANDSBERG, Times Staff Writer=20

?????Calpine Corp., on a breakneck pace to boost the amount of electricity =
it=20
produces in California, announced plans Friday to build a major power plant=
=20
in western Riverside County near the terminus of a hotly contested=20
transmission line.
?????The plant, the 10th the company has proposed constructing in Californi=
a,=20
would be in the unincorporated Romoland area between Hemet and Perris, and=
=20
would supply enough power for about 450,000 homes.
?????""As a California-based company, we are extremely pleased to, yet again=
,=20
move forward on a project such as this,"" said John King, senior vice=20
president of business development for Calpine, which is based in San Jose.=
=20
The company has been eager to distance itself from the out-of-state energy=
=20
suppliers whom Gov. Gray Davis has portrayed as public enemies for their ro=
le=20
in California's energy crisis.
?????State officials greeted the announcement somewhat warily, noting that=
=20
Calpine has announced plans before that didn't pan out. Until the company=
=20
formally applies for licensing, the California Energy Commission will reser=
ve=20
comment on the plans, spokesman Rob Schlichting said.
?????""It's basically a trial balloon,"" he said of the announcement.
?????Calpine officials said they intend to file an application for licensin=
g=20
with the commission in July and to begin construction of the $325-million=
=20
plant sometime in the middle of next year. They said the plant could be=20
running by 2004.
?????Greg Lamberg, Calpine's director of business development, said the=20
company has already held extensive discussions with local officials in=20
Riverside County and has encountered no community opposition.
?????""We're finding just the reverse--we're finding a tremendous level of=
=20
support in the community,"" Lamberg said.
?????Local officials could not immediately be reached for comment. There ha=
s=20
been substantial opposition to another electrical project in the same=20
vicinity, a proposed 500,000-volt transmission line that San Diego Gas &=20
Electric wants to build through southwestern Riverside County.
?????The line would end at Southern California Edison's Valley substation i=
n=20
Romoland. Calpine's proposed Inland Empire Energy Center would be built abo=
ut=20
half a mile from the substation, on vacant land along California 74 near=20
Interstate 215.
?????Proximity to the Edison substation--and to a nearby natural gas=20
pipeline--make the location ideal, Lamberg said. Calpine officials said the=
y=20
don't expect opposition to the SDG&E transmission line to translate into=20
opposition to their project.
?????""The reason folks are opposed to that line is that it's a means for Sa=
n=20
Diego to import power,"" said Calpine spokesman Kent Robertson. ""What we're=
=20
doing is, we're building projects to serve the local community. We think it=
's=20
kind of an apples-and-oranges comparison.""
?????The area immediately surrounding the site is industrial, and Lamberg=
=20
said the company believes the plant will not cast a large ""footprint"" on th=
e=20
environment. Calpine's plans call for a 600-megawatt combined cycle plant=
=20
that burns natural gas to generate electricity. Combined cycle plants, whic=
h=20
recycle their heat to make electricity a second time, are considered=20
extremely efficient and far cleaner than older, single cycle plants.
?????If the plant is licensed and built, it will help cement Calpine's=20
position as a major player in the California energy market. The company now=
=20
owns 11 mostly small, geothermal power plants in the state but has plans=20
underway for nine gas-fired plants that would add more than 5,000 megawatts=
=20
of power, enough to supply about 4 million homes. Three major plants are=20
already under construction in Northern California.
?????The Southland plant would be the third new generator in Riverside=20
County. Wisvest is building a 520-megawatt plant in Blythe, and there are=

plans for a smaller, ""peaker"" plant in that city.

ARROYO GRANDE, Calif. -- Plans to cut down hundreds of oak trees to make su=

Pacific Gas & Electric Co. says it must remove trees under its power lines =

the state will need every watt it can get.=20
Critics say the utility just wants to save gardening costs.=20
""The bottom line is the dollar,"" said Jim Johandes, 51, whose avocado ranch=
=20
backs up to PG&E property in a rural canyon. He drove his vehicle to the to=
p=20
of a hill one day last week and parked under giant towers bearing power lin=
es=20
that carry 500,000 volts of electricity .=20
""Everything you see under these lines will be history,"" he said, pointing t=
o=20
a thick canopy of oaks straddling the rolling brown hills.=20
The controversy over the oaks has not helped the battered reputation of the=
=20
utility.=20
Johandes, a big, white-bearded man who owned a Whittier company that=20
installed burglar and fire alarm systems until moving to the Central Coast=
=20
eight years ago, has opened his property to demonstrators.=20
Some sign-carrying activists pressed their case before the San Luis Obispo=
=20
County Board of Supervisors last week. One supervisor, Khatchik Achadjian,=
=20
called on PG&E to put the tree-chopping project ""on hold until a compromise=
=20
can be developed.""=20
So far, PG&E has shown no indication of scaling back plans to begin clearin=
g=20
away undergrowth this month. Utility officials say protesters overstate the=
=20
damage, as well as the project's intent.=20
""Trees and the environment are very important to everyone, including PG&E,""=
=20
said Bill Roake, a spokesman for the company.=20
If PG&E has done anything to be ashamed of, he said, it is failing to=20
communicate effectively with the public. ""We did not do a good job,"" Roake=
=20
said.=20
Some have accused PG&E of planning to clear-cut 15 miles of right-of-way fr=
om=20
the bluff on the coast where Diablo is located. Utility officials say fewer=
=20
than half the trees will be removed from a swath of brushland less than two=
=20
miles long between Carpenter and Price canyons. That is about 104 acres=20
altogether.=20
The goal, Roake said, is to open up the canopy so that fire cannot race alo=
ng=20
the tops of the trees and threaten the power lines.=20
""The lines are right above a very, very heavy [wood and brush] fuel load,""=
=20
said Roake. ""If there is a fire, you could have lines disrupted coming out =
of=20
Diablo.""=20
Diablo Canyon is PG&E's single largest producer of power. Even if the flame=
s=20
did not reach the overhead lines themselves, smoke from a fire could put=20
particulates in the air causing an arc, or crossover between adjacent lines=
.=20
Known as ""phasing,"" that would essentially short-circuit the transmission=
=20
lines. Last year, Roake said, a small brush fire in the area knocked out th=
e=20
lines for more than six hours, though part of that problem was an unrelated=
=20
equipment failure.=20
A worst case scenario, however, could knock out Diablo Canyon for three to=
=20
four days, Roake said.=20
PG&E said the cutting is being done to satisfy the state's Independent Syst=
em=20
Operator, a nonprofit corporation whose job is to ensure the safety and=20
reliability of the state's energy grid.=20
Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman, said the ISO did not order PG&E to remov=
e=20
trees. ""PG&E's preference was to remove trees rather than trim them,"" she=
=20
said in an e-mail response to The Times.=20
Roake acknowledged that the ISO didn't tell the utility to remove the trees=
.=20
""We felt this was the best way to keep the [grid system] safe and reliable,=
""=20
he said.=20
As for allegations that PG&E is cutting down trees to save money on=20
maintenance, Roake acknowledged that safeguarding 108,000 miles of=20
transmission lines is a big job. The utility spends $138 million annually t=
o=20
trim or remove trees and brush.=20
But the tree project has nothing to do with its cash crunch, according to=
=20
PG&E. The Carpenter Canyon project was planned two years ago.=20
Johandes doesn't believe it. ""They are doing it so they don't have to do=20
routine maintenance,"" he said.=20
PG&E has not made the argument, but conceivably could say it's not anybody'=
s=20
business what it does with vegetation on its property. Oaks are not=20
endangered. There are 11 million acres of oak woodlands in California ,=20
according to the California Oak Foundation.=20
On the other hand, the oak looms large in the California myth. ""It is kind =
of=20
our signature tree,"" said Janet Cobb, president of the foundation.=20
The state has lost 1.5 million acres of oaks since 1945, according to Cobb.=
=20
The PG&E plan, she said, is ""a travesty. I can't imagine what they're=20
thinking. Yes, some trees need to be thinned out, but this is butchering.""=
=20
Roake denied that. PG&E said it is approaching the project cautiously. The=
=20
first thing that will be done when work begins next week will be mowing dow=
n=20
the grassy underbrush known as ladder fuel. That could be an ignition point=
=20
for fire. After that, dead and diseased trees will be taken out.=20
""Then we'll see what that does for the canopy,"" he said.

SACRAMENTO -- The phone rang and it was the governor. ""Just wanted to talk =

Gov. Gray Davis was feeling good--about plunging wholesale electricity pric=

ll=20
numbers.=20
Davis believes his ""summit"" with President Bush two weeks ago in L.A.=20
burnished his image. His pollster, Paul Maslin, found that the governor's j=
ob=20
approval rating rose from 46% in early April to 52% after the Bush meeting.=
=20
The president's job rating in California , meanwhile, fell from 56% to 43%.=
=20
Bush handed Davis a microphone to shout his message: that he's building=20
plants and conserving electricity --but only federal regulators can order=
=20
price relief, and they've refused. That word finally got through to people,=
=20
the governor thinks.=20
And this was why Davis had phoned--to stress that he does have a plan, an=
=20
endgame, and it's working. Critics to the contrary.=20
""It's premature to declare victory. It's not the time to pop champagne=20
corks,"" he said. ""But we're turning the corner.""=20
Davis must have said ""turning the corner"" and attributed it to ""leverage"" 2=
0=20
times in our 30-minute conversation. And the anti-generator rhetoric rolled=
=20
naturally off his tongue, having by now become integral to his everyday=20
speech.=20
""The name of this game is leverage,"" he said. ""If you don't have leverage=
=20
over these cowboys, they will steal you blind. They'll take every dime you=
=20
have, all the clothes you own, and be laughing all the way to the bank.""=20
These cowboys, of course, are mostly Texans. Critics have protested that a=
=20
governor cannot keep calling people names and still expect to do business=
=20
with them.=20
""That's the only thing that gets their attention,"" Davis asserted. ""They're=

years ago at a time we're conserving. . . .""=20
A confluence of events has provided the leverage, Davis said:=20

long-term deals at reasonable prices, reducing dependence on the sky-high=

""And then you have a governor who's quick to get in the face of greedy=20
out-of-state generators,"" Davis continued. ""Shame them for being the highly=

A governor also threatening to tax windfall profits and seize power plants.=
=20
Davis recently went after municipal utilities, as well, after learning they=
=20
occasionally had been gouging the state even worse than the private=20
profiteers. The governor warned he'd seize their excess power unless they=
=20
agreed to sell it at a small profit, maybe 15%.=20
He was especially irked at the L.A. DWP, and told both Mayor Richard Riorda=
n=20
and Mayor-elect James K. Hahn.=20
""They didn't like it,"" Davis recalled. ""They said it sounds like a threat. =

to be taking advantage of the state during its time of need. We certainly=

I reminded Davis that critics fault him for not acting more quickly a year=
=20
ago. They complain he should have pressed for long-term contracts then and=
=20
pushed for consumer rate hikes to salvage private utilities. Does he=20
acknowledge he could have moved faster?=20

Electricity traders' tech habits get scrutiny=20

BY JENNIFER BJORHUS=20

Mercury News=20


State officials investigating California's extraordinary energy prices are=
=20
zeroing in on how energy traders use the technology tools of their professi=
on=20
-- from e-mail and specialized software to Internet energy data sites and=
=20
online trading floors.=20
This technology may be key, they say, to helping traders acquire the intima=
te=20
knowledge needed to manipulate California's troubled energy market. With=20
minute-to-minute knowledge of market conditions, some traders went even=20
further, two lawsuits charge, illegally coordinating bids and sending=20
electricity prices to record-breaking levels.=20
The state Attorney General's Office has subpoenaed from power generators=20
software used to formulate bidding strategies, names of employees providing=
=20
computer support, communications with a prominent industry Web site and the=
=20
name of firms that handle computer networks.=20
And a state Senate committee has hired an information technology consultant=
=20
to help them look into how traders tracked patterns on the state's=20
Internet-based spot market, among other things.=20
``Once you were knowledgeable about its operations, the opportunity to game=
=20
it became pretty obvious,'' said Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Garden Grove, who chairs=
=20
the committee.=20
Anti-trust laws=20
Working together, or colluding, to fix prices is illegal and violates state=
=20
and federal anti-trust laws.=20
Sharing sensitive industry data, if it involved financial markets, would be=
=20
considered insider trading and would be treated far differently, said Anjal=
i=20
Sheffrin, head of market analysis for the Independent System Operator, whic=
h=20
manages the state's power grid.=20
The Securities and Exchange Commission polices the nation's stock markets,=
=20
but wholesale energy trading goes largely unwatched by federal regulators.=
=20
San Diego attorney Mike Aguirre agreed with Sheffrin. Aguirre is part of a=
=20
team of lawyers who have filed two lawsuits against leading power generator=
s=20
such as Dynegy, Duke Energy and Williams Energy Services.=20
``It's basically an embryonic kind of trading market that involves the=20
sharing of inside information, and the only reason they're getting away wit=
h=20
it is there's no SEC cop,'' he said.=20
Energy companies dismiss these charges as speculation.=20
``All of these `What ifs?'?'' said Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel. ``The fa=
ct=20
of the matter is we've played by the rules, we've acted ethically, we haven=
't=20
done anything wrong.''=20
Energy companies say the way they use technology is all above board.=20
``That's something that we're proud of, that we have all of the tools to do=
=20
the best possible job in the trading,'' said Paula Hall-Collins, spokeswoma=
n=20
for Tulsa-based Williams Co.=20
Not everyone is persuaded that energy companies actually conspired to hike=
=20
prices.=20
Some public officials and energy industry players call the technology focus=
 a=20
red herring. California's energy problems are far more fundamental, they sa=
y,=20
than click-happy energy traders with spreadsheets. The now-defunct Californ=
ia=20
Power Exchange, for example, was something of a sitting duck, unable to=20
freely shop around for the best electricity prices.=20
Wealth of data=20
Other experts believe the sheer wealth of data floating around -- from rive=
r=20
flows to 30-day forecasts of power line outages -- gives traders an unfair=
=20
advantage. ``That's exactly the issue,'' said Severin Borenstein, director =
of=20
the University of California Energy Institute. ``The issue is whether all=
=20
this information is actually doing more harm to competition than benefit to=
=20
the efficiency of procuring and selling power.''=20
The best illustration of this is a somewhat legendary Web site blunder.=20
In that incident, an energy industry association called the Western Systems=
=20
Coordinating Council posted highly sensitive real-time data about=20
transmission of extra-high voltage electricity in California.=20
Alarmed that such information could be used to game the market, the state's=
=20
grid operator last October demanded that the trade group take the informati=
on=20
off the site, which it did.=20
A former energy trader who spoke to the Mercury News on the condition that =
he=20
not be identified, said: ``When you can calculate exactly what a market nee=
ds=20
and where its surplus is going to come from, then you have the ability to=
=20
essentially fix prices. It's like a linear equation. You know exactly what=
=20
the end equation is going to be.''=20
At issue are how traders employ the tools that, like the telephone and fax=
=20
machine, are standard in trading electricity: software, data Web sites and=
=20
Internet energy exchanges.=20
Dunn and other public officials acknowledge that it isn't clear how=20
technology was used in suspected abuses. And no one has turned up slam-dunk=
=20
evidence of collusion.=20
The ISO has done extensive studies that conclude traders drove up prices=20
through gaming. The high prices have cost the state at least $6.7 billion=
=20
since May 2000.=20
``Energy traders trade information among themselves,'' the ISO's Sheffrin=
=20
charged, comparing it to insider-trading. ``These traders are calling each=
=20
other up all the time.''=20
The former energy trader who talked to the Mercury News agreed energy trade=
rs=20
as a very incestuous group.=20
They talk and e-mail every day. ``Sometimes many, many, many times a day,''=
=20
he said. ``Some of them have instant messaging.'' He said he believes it=20
could amount to ``de facto collusion.''=20
But proving collusion in court is extremely difficult.=20
The sticking point, said UC's Borenstein, is showing exactly what energy=20
traders did with the information.=20
``These guys aren't actually sitting down in a room together,'' Borenstein=
=20
said. ``They sort of watched each other and said, `Well, other firms are=20
keeping capacity out and we will too.'?''=20
The former energy trader said he doubted that investigators would prove=20
collusion because traders will cover their tracks. ``They're expunging=20
hard-drive data as we speak,'' he said. ``The documents are long gone.''=20
Lawsuits=20
Two class-action lawsuits, filed on behalf of taxpayers by San Francisco an=
d=20
by Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, accuse the energy companies of colluding to=20
drive up prices. Neither lawsuit clearly documents how the energy companies=
=20
engaged in secretive data-sharing.=20
The Bustamante suit, however, targets a new Internet site for wholesale=20
energy trading launched last fall by heavy-hitter energy companies such as=
=20
Duke and Reliant. The Atlanta-based Web site, IntercontinentalExchange, is=
=20
one of at least a dozen such electronic trading floors that have popped up =
on=20
the Internet in the last four years. None of these trading exchanges -- whi=
ch=20
analysts say are the wave of the future -- are regulated.=20
IntercontinentalExchange declined to comment since it is not a party to the=
=20
suit.=20
The lawsuit charges the site ``has several features that support collusive=
=20
behavior amongst market participants.''=20
One is that only approved traders have access to IntercontinentalExchange a=
nd=20
those traders can pick who they want to trade with and shut other traders=
=20
out. And more importantly, Aguirre said, the energy companies who own many =
of=20
these Web exchanges get the tremendous benefit of having a record of all th=
e=20
trades.=20
``It gives them an enormous amount of market data that no one else has acce=

Perhaps Davis will even be weakened by a challenge from within his own=20

Don't be too hasty.=20
From January to June, the GOP's prospects undoubtedly thawed. Two candidate=

state, and Bill Simon, a Los Angeles businessman and philanthropist.=20
But here's a bit of history discouraging for the Bills, neither of whom is=

recognized by even half the voters in the state. The last California govern=
or=20
to be denied a second term by the voters was Culbert Olson, in 1943.=20
Davis will not answer to all the voters in March, only Democratic ones. Cou=
rt=20
rulings have eliminated California's short-lived blanket primaries and=20
restored the partisan contests. So he has two summers before the November=
=20
2002 election to get the power puzzle solved.=20
All the same, politics is an arena in which anything can happen. (Your hono=

I call Jesse Ventura to the stand.) And what Republicans more and more are=
=20
hoping will happen is that Los Angeles will send to the governor's office i=
ts=20
departing mayor, Richard Riordan. Riordan says he's thinking about running.=
=20
A Field Poll in late May showed Riordan even with Davis in voter preference=
,=20
while Jones and Simon trailed by double digits. President Bush has called o=
n=20
Riordan to run. Last week, 14 Republican legislators, of the 44 in the=20
Assembly and Senate, and 16 of California's 20 Republican members of Congre=
ss=20
signed a letter urging Riordan to be a candidate.=20
Given the beaten down state of the Republican party in California, one of=
=20
Riordan's advantages for the general election is that he is thought of firs=
t=20
as the mayor of Los Angeles, and only second as a Republican. It's an=20
accurate picture. He opposed the immigrant-bashing Proposition 187. He=20
supports gay rights and is generally pro-choice. He has endorsed Democratic=
=20
Sen. Dianne Feinstein in the past.=20
Plenty of Republicans will find plenty to dislike there. But they should ge=

=20
Dan Lungren, the GOP candidate in 1998, got pounded. The 2000 election=20
offered no suggestion that California voters were moving rightward.=20
Riordan, a very wealthy man, could put $30 million or more of his own money=
=20
into the campaign, which is what Davis already has collected. Yet Riordan's=
=20
performance as L.A. mayor insulates him from the charge that he is a rich m=
an=20
playing at politics.=20
Jones, who is from Fresno, has done a commendable job in his eight years as=
=20
secretary of state. But he offended many Republicans by the way in which he=
=20
switched from supporting George W. Bush to John McCain in last year's=20
presidential race. Simon has the money to make himself and his message know=
n,=20
but right now both are unknown.=20
Maybe Jones and Simon can make the cases for themselves over the summer and=
=20
fall. But Riordan would enter the race with a huge head start.=20
As for a challenger to Davis from within the party, everything depends on=
=20
this summer. Only if it is an ordeal of blackouts and staggering state=20
electricity bills is Davis in danger. The political taboo against striking =
at=20
an incumbent is powerful.=20
Further, those most likely and able to mount a palace coup -- Attorney=20
General Bill Lockyer and Treasurer Phil Angelides, to pick two -- would be=
=20
the most viable candidates to succeed Davis four years from now. Why would=

they risk a suicide mission instead of waiting?=20
The first half of 2001 damaged Davis's political standing. But in politics,=

California Gets a Reprieve As Natural Gas Prices Drop

DALLAS, June 10 -- The price of natural gas sold into Southern California h=

fallen sharply the last week after both the free fall in electricity prices=
=20
and the expiration of a pipeline contract held by the El Paso Corporation=
=20
that is the subject of an inquiry by federal regulators.=20
The change in prices has prompted critics of El Paso to suggest that the dr=

prices high.=20
But a lawyer for the company says that while gas prices in Southern=20
California are lower than in recent months, they are mostly still higher th=
an=20
in other parts of the country. And he said the decline that has taken place=
=20
was largely because of the factors that have caused California electricity=
=20
prices to plunge unexpectedly since late last month.=20
Whatever the reason, lower gas prices, if they continue, bode well for=20
California electricity rate payers because gas is a crucial fuel for=20
generating electricity . But California officials have said the drop in gas=
=20
prices may prove short-lived, just as many experts think the state's lower=
=20
electricity prices may be temporary.=20
Analysts have said the steep run-up in gas prices that began last year was=
=20
caused by factors like soaring demand from electricity generators, a shorta=
ge=20
of pipeline capacity and market rules in California that did not require=20
companies to store enough gas for winter.=20
The California Public Utilities Commission and Southern California Edison=
=20
have also contended that El Paso used its contractual control of a large=20
amount of pipeline space into California to curtail gas flows so it could=
=20
drive prices higher. El Paso denies that, saying California is trying to ma=
ke=20
the company a scapegoat for its failed energy policies. An administrative=
=20
judge is hearing the accusations at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissio=
n=20
in Washington.=20
The contract at issue expired May 31, and control of the pipeline space was=

n=20
California during ''bidweek'' -- the process in the last seven days of the=

=20
was $11.70 per million British thermal units, or nearly triple the prices i=
n=20
the rest of the nation. But by late last week, daily prices for gas had=20
dropped to about $4 to some Southern California destinations.=20
''It reflects that the market's recognition that the capacity is no longer=

held by one major player, and I think the market knows the difference betwe=
en=20
competition and a monopoly,'' said Kevin J. Lipson, a lawyer for Southern=
=20
California Edison. ''It reflects the benefits of competition.''=20
But, a lawyer for El Paso, William S. Scherman, said the expiration of the=
=20
contract has not affected prices.=20
''Looking at prices on a daily basis is invalid,'' Mr. Scherman said, becau=
se=20
most gas sold is priced on a month-to-month basis.=20
''Prices may be coming down because of supply and demand and other=20

Davis loosens limits on older plants=20
By Chris Bowman
Bee Staff Writer
(Published June 12, 2001)=20
Gov. Gray Davis on Monday waived all local smog rules that limited how long=
=20
older and dirtier natural gas-fired power plants can run this summer.=20
Davis said he issued the order under his emergency powers to help avoid=20
blackouts.=20
""We are doing everything possible to keep the lights on this summer,"" he=20
said.=20
The order modifies a directive that Davis issued Feb. 9 that required local=
=20
air pollution control districts to extend hours of operation when plants=20
approached their permitted limits. Plant operators offset the extra emissio=
ns=20
by paying the districts a ""mitigation fee."" Those fees fund programs that=
=20
reduce emissions from other sources.=20
Some municipal power utilities, however, argued that they shouldn't have to=
=20
make a case to the air district for additional hours when the need to provi=
de=20
for more energy is so apparent.=20
Under the directive issued Monday, power production to meet demand anywhere=
=20
in the state will not count against the hours of operation allotted in the=
=20
smog permits.=20
Waiving the operation limits should encourage operators to increase the use=
=20
of these ""peaker"" plants, which are designed to operate only during periods=
=20
of peak energy use, state officials said.=20
""This will allow us to offer that excess capacity to the state,"" said David=
=20
Wiggs, interim general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and=
=20
Power.=20
Air districts generally impose limits on hours of operation on a relatively=
=20
small number of older, dirtier plants, as a more economical alternative to=
=20
installing modern pollution controls. The order, which is effective=20
immediately, could provide up to 1,200 additional megawatts in the state th=
is=20
summer, enough to power about 900,000 houses, state officials said.=20
Kellan Fluckinger, an energy adviser to Davis, argued that in the long run=
=20
the directive will result in a net gain for air quality.=20
Expanding the use of the peaker plants, he said, will help avoid blackouts=
=20
and the attendant use of emergency diesel generators, which typically emit=
=20
about 10 times more smog-forming emissions than the dirtiest of natural=20
gas-fired plants.=20
In addition, the pollution mitigation fees paid to allow expanded operation=
=20
of the peaker plants would go toward local efforts to cut pollution from=20
other sources, such as diesel-powered trucks and water pumps on farms.=20
Several air districts, including those in the Sacramento region, offer=20
financial incentives to businesses to replace dirty diesel engines with=20
cleaner-burning ones sooner than they normally would.=20
""They have more applicants than the ability to fund them,"" said Michael=20
Scheible, deputy executive officer of the state Air Resources Board.=20
The governor's office also is expected to announce financial incentives for=
=20
companies to press their backup diesel generators into service to forestall=
=20
blackouts this summer, according to S. David Freeman, a top Davis energy=20
adviser.=20
""Whether or not we do that is still being discussed,"" Scheible said.=20
Under the plan, participating businesses would disconnect from the=20
electricity grid when power supplies are at Stage 3 and turn on backup=20

That leaves the PUC with a limited role in the rate hike process, Wood=20
acknowledged.=20
""We are here to spread the pain,"" said the commissioner, who noted that=20
customers who use 130 percent or less of the baseline amount are shielded=

from any rate hike by state law. The baseline allowance, which is printed o=

Temporary takeovers to be spelled out in bill=20

a weapon so scary and extreme it could never be responsibly used.=20
Assemblyman Juan Vargas, D-San Diego, wants to change that.=20
Vargas is promoting a plan that he says will avoid huge costs and years of=
=20
litigation by allowing the state to take over electricity generating plants=
=20
temporarily.=20
Once the electricity crisis has passed, the state would give back the plant=

g=20
it outright. Call it plant seizure lite.=20
The freshman lawmaker will present his plan today to the Assembly Judiciary=
=20
Committee, which is expected to approve the measure along party lines.=20
""It's a big deal to take over a person's property,"" said Vargas. ""But this =
is=20
reasonable. It's rational. They forced us into it and it's time to fight=20

Some believe the state, by seizing power plants, could obtain electricity f=

overpriced.=20
But Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a=
=20
group of power generating companies, said the Vargas plan would hurt the=20
state's efforts to build enough plants to ease the crisis.=20
""I don't think there is such a thing as seizure lite,"" he said. ""Any=20
discussion of plant seizures for a day or a lifetime has a devastating effe=

Even a temporary state takeover would discourage investors who want to buil=

would also discourage bond investors whom the state wants to tap to repay=

state taxpayers for buying high-priced electricity on the spot market.=20
Vargas admits that the governor could temporarily take over plants now=20
without waiting for legislative action. Still, he said, a bill would give t=
he=20
governor more support.=20
""It gives the idea legitimacy,"" he said.=20
At issue are the generating plants sold by the state's major utilities,=20
mostly to southern-based companies. Those companies have made huge profits=

while charging skyrocketing prices that have caused the financial collapse =
of=20
the state's two major utilities.=20
Davis has portrayed those companies as ruthless price gougers that maximize=

plants, but then backed away. Few believe the centrist Democrat wants to ri=
sk=20
such a move that could alienate the business community, especially now when=
=20
the energy market is showing signs of stabilizing.=20
Additionally, a permanent takeover could force the state to pay billions of=
=20
dollars for an outdated, aging facility, said Vargas, because the value of=
=20
the plant would be determined by the high prices the plant is now charging=
=20
for electricity.=20
In his research, Vargas said he found that the U.S. Supreme Court in 1949=

This is unrelated to a request by San Diego Gas & Electric for a rate=20

The state water agency says it needs an increase to cover the cost of=20

Until now, proposals for electricity rate increases have come before the=20
California Public Utilities Commission, a state constitutional body charged=

with reviewing the proposals, taking public input, and setting rates at a=

level that is just and reasonable.=20
Not this time.=20
The same law that authorized the Department of Water Resources to buy power=
=20
also empowered the department to judge the merits of its own rate increase=

proposals. The department has determined its request for what amounts to $9=

The water department also has informed the utilities commission that it wil=

needs the increases to cover its costs under the contracts.=20
Gov. Gray Davis insists keeping these agreements secret is essential to=20

supplies.=20
The state utilities commission, meanwhile, is left to determine only how to=
=20
disperse the department rate increase among SDG&E customers, not how much o=

an increase is appropriate. The commission calculates that the Department o=

rate of 14.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. That total includes a 6.5-cent charge=

Attorney Michael Aguirre, who is representing Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante in a=

that the process surrounding the department's rate increase is unusual. But=

Wood noted that the commission sought to shield low-and middle-income=20

served by Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison. He said=
=20
the hikes in those areas are also ""steeply tiered"" to hit hardest those who=

But Wood, a former utility workers union official who opposed deregulation,=

conceded discomfort with the role that has fallen to the PUC.=20
""I would rather be in a more orderly, regulated world where the PUC had=20

Air standards lowered for power plants=20
DAVIS ORDER: They can run overtime=20

.DTL=20
Gov. Gray Davis eased California's air pollution standards for power plants=
=20
yesterday with an executive order that will allow some to run overtime this=
=20
summer and squeeze out extra electricity.=20
Energy advisers said the governor's order actually would cause less polluti=
on=20
in the coming months because it allows natural-gas powered plants to run=20
longer and reduce the need to run dirtier diesel-powered generators often=
=20
used as backups.=20
""If you don't run these, you're either going to have outages, or you're goi=
ng=20
to run something dirtier,"" said Davis adviser Kellan Fluckiger.=20
Under the current state of emergency, the governor has sweeping powers to=
=20
make changes in the law.=20
The Davis administration roughly estimated that about 1,200 megawatts in=20
extra power could be produced and sold to California, enough to supply an=
=20
estimated 1.2 million homes. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power,=
=20
which has been selling its extra electricity to the state, said it might be=
=20
able to supply 1,000 megawatts alone.=20
Under the current law, power plants in California are allowed to emit=20
specific amounts of major pollutants -- nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide=
=20
-- and then must shut down when they reach a federal and state quota.=20
The executive order allows power plants in California to bypass those=20
environmental standards as long as they sell the extra power to the state o=
r=20
another California-based utility. The order lasts until Davis rescinds it.=
=20
EXEMPTION TRADE-OFFS
In exchange for the exemptions, the power generators must pay penalties for=
=20
the extra pollution they cause. The fines would probably range around $37.5=
0=20
for every megawatt produced during these peak periods, according to Catheri=
ne=20
Witherspoon with the California Air Resources Board.=20
Although prices are falling, a megawatt hour has sold on the daily market f=
or=20
more than $500 -- at one point soaring to as much as $1,900.=20
Money from the fines would be put into local pollution-control accounts and=
=20
used to reduce emissions elsewhere, Witherspoon said. She said the governor=
's=20
order was the best way to get more power and still maintain environmental=
=20
standards.=20
Witherspoon said the federal Environmental Protection Agency, which needs t=
o=20
approve the new standards set by Davis, had been ""very cooperative.""=20
""Bringing the maximum amount of power out of natural gas capacity is really=
=20
going to help,"" Witherspoon said. ""If we don't get every last megawatt we=
=20
can, we will see people turning to diesel more frequently.""=20
The South Coast Air Quality District, which is the largest and most pollute=
d=20
area of the state, already has been allowing power plants to produce more=
=20
power in exchange for higher fines, said Ralph Cavanagh of Natural Resource=
s=20
Defense Council.=20
""The key is whether the mitigation fund being set up will actually be used =
to=20
offset pollution,"" he said. The ""jury is still out"" on how successful the=
=20
program has been, Cavanagh said.=20
Cavanagh agreed that using natural gas plants was much better than diesel,=
=20
something the Davis administration is considering. ""Clearly we want to=20
suppress the operation of diesel,"" he said. ""To the extent that it reduces=
=20
diesel, that is a benefit.""=20
The state's municipal utilities have for months been asking Davis for=20
yesterday's exemption so they can run their natural-gas-powered plants=20
longer, and presumably make some money off the increase in sales. Power=20
prices are at their highest in history.=20
Davis has previously threatened the public utilities takeover because of th=
e=20
high prices being charged the state, which has spent about $8.3 billion to=
=20
purchase power since January. The utilities have said they are only passing=
=20
along the high cost of the natural gas used to produce the electricity.=20
""This was the issue we had to have solved or we could not offer any of our=
=20
excess capacity to the state,"" said David Wiggs, general manager of the L.A=
.=20
Department of Water and Power.=20
The price of the extra power is ""being negotiated now with the governor's=

Federal regulators widened their investigation yesterday of a Texas natural=
=20
gas firm accused of inflating statewide energy prices, reversing an earlier=
=20
order that had partially exonerated the company.=20
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's 4-to-0 ruling in the investigati=
on=20
of El Paso Corp., backed by Pat Wood, the Bush administration's new=20
appointee, was greeted by California's chief energy regulator as a turning=
=20
point in the commission's attitude toward state complaints of price gouging=
.=20
The commission's action ""signals a whole new chapter of vigilant=20
enforcement,"" said Loretta Lynch, president of the state Public Utilities=
=20
Commission.=20
The federal commission reopened the question of whether El Paso rigged the=
=20
bid for a huge block of capacity on its gas pipeline in favor of its own=20
marketing affiliate, thus stifling competition that could have prevented=20
natural gas prices from soaring to the levels they reached last winter.=20
In the past year, gas from the Southwest has sold at the California border =
at=20
prices as much as 10 times the nationwide average, driving up the price of=
=20
consumers' heating bills and of electricity produced at power plants that r=
un=20
on natural gas.=20
In March, before Wood was appointed, the commission cleared El Paso of=20
complaints by California officials that the firm had engineered the takeove=
r=20
by its marketing arm of more than one-third of the space on its pipeline in=
to=20
California. That pipeline supplies half of the state's gas.=20
In the same ruling, however, the commission ordered a trial-like hearing on=
=20
the separate question of whether El Paso exercised near-monopoly market pow=
er=20
to boost its profits.=20
The PUC, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison say El=
=20
Paso's pipeline affiliate and its marketing subsidiary combined to prevent=
=20
competing shippers from importing natural gas, jacking up prices.=20
The hearing, which has already stretched from an original schedule of four=
=20
days to more than five weeks, will now be expanded for evidence on=20
accusations that l Paso broke federal regulations against preferential=20
treatment for affiliates.=20
COMPANY NOT WORRIED
El Paso spokeswoman Norma Dunn said the probe would reinforce the=20
commission's original decision that El Paso was innocent of rigging the=20
pipeline bid.=20
""We're confident they'll use the same information to reach the same=20
conclusion,"" Dunn said.=20
Harvey Morris, the PUC's lead attorney in the case, said the order could le=
ad=20
to harsher penalties against El Paso if an administrative law judge found=
=20
wrongdoing.=20
Lynch said last week that El Paso should be forced to pay back California f=
or=20
what the state considers its excess costs during the 15-month contract=20
between the company and its marketing arm, El Paso Merchant Energy. The sta=
te=20
has never estimated that figure, but consultants for Edison say the alleged=
=20
market manipulation cost California an extra $3.7 billion.=20
The PUC first asked the federal commission to void the contract in April=20
2000. By the time the commission ordered a hearing, the contract was close =
to=20
its expiration date -- this past May 31.=20
Wood, who was sworn in to the commission last week, said in a concurring=20
opinion yesterday that such cases should be investigated promptly.=20
""In the framework of active energy markets, it is critical that the=20
commission act expeditiously on complaints,"" Wood wrote.=20
RAISING THE BAR
Wood's remark ""seems to raise the bar for FERC"" in its role as a market=20
watchdog, Lynch said.=20
There has been much speculation about how Wood's presence will affect the=
=20
federal commission, which has been at odds with California officials over=
=20
virtually every area of energy policy.=20
Wood, a 38-year-old lawyer, was nominated to the Texas Public Utilities=20
Commission by then-Gov. George W. Bush in 1995. At the time, Bush said that=
=20
Wood ""shares my conservative philosophy"" and would bring a free-market=20
approach to regulation.=20
Bush administration officials have hinted that Wood will replace Curt Heber=
t=20
as chairman of the federal commission, though White House spokesman Ari=20
Fleischer dampened the speculation last week, saying Hebert was not in dang=
er=20
of losing his job.=20
On his recent trip to the state, Bush said he had assigned Wood to=20
investigate the high cost of natural gas delivered to California.=20
Wood has spoken to Gov. Gray Davis twice on the phone about the energy=20
crisis. The two plan to meet in Washington on June 20, said Steve Maviglio,=
 a=20
spokesman for Davis.=20
""The governor was enthusiastic about Pat Wood after his conversations with=
=20
him,"" Maviglio said. ""He feels the commissioner understands the issues out=
=20
here, and he promises to provide some relief in one form or another.""=20
Davis declined to comment on yesterday's decision until he had time to read=
=20
it.=20
The PUC's Morris said that it was no coincidence that gas prices in=20
California had dropped dramatically since El Paso Merchant Energy's contrac=
t=20
expired May 31, and 30 competing shippers started to share the pipeline=20
capacity.=20
""It's no longer the 800-pound gorilla on the El Paso system,"" Morris said.=
=20
El Paso spokeswoman Dunn said prices had dropped because of a wide range of=
=20
factors, including mild weather, increased hydroelectric power production a=

A series of events -- from plummeting wholesale energy and natural gas pric=

=20
Davis, who is up for re-election next year, is battling his image as a=20
middle-of-the-road leader and has adopted a confrontational style to deal=
=20
with the power crisis.=20
In May, he hired high-powered crisis control specialists Chris Lehane and=
=20
Mark Fabiani, trained at the Clinton White House and in the Al Gore=20
presidential campaign. He declared ""war"" on Texas-based energy wholesalers.=
=20
Davis also attacked the Bush administration for opposing price controls on=

Vermont Sen. James Jeffords announced he would defect from the GOP, handing=

the majority and committee chairmanships to Democrats who favor price caps =

President Bush, criticized for failing to visit California since taking=20
office, traveled to the state and met with Davis.=20
When the state Energy Commission announced that Californians had cut power=
=20
use by 11 percent in May over the previous year, Davis declared a personal=
=20
victory. He had called for residents and businesses to conserve 10 percent.=
=20
Last week, wholesale electricity prices plunged from more than $500 a=20
megawatt hour to about $50 a megawatt hour -- their lowest level in a year =
--=20
while natural gas prices also dropped.=20
Some experts attributed the price spiral to conservation efforts and mild=

=20
Davis signing long-term contracts with energy providers.=20
""We may still have some difficult days ahead of us in the summer but it's=

pretty clear that the governor's strategy has now borne some fruit,"" said=

California Republicans, meanwhile, are fortifying their own campaign=20
strategy. The state party hired veteran consultant Rob Stutzman to counter=

Davis' hiring of Lehane and Fabiani.=20
And Stutzman says Davis has little for which to take credit.=20

Power plant force-fed to Gonzales=20

If he had his way, San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales said yesterday, he still wou=
ld=20
be opposed to construction of a 600-megawatt power plant in a neighborhood =
in=20
the southern part of his town.=20
But he didn't get his way, and so he was forced to do the best he could wit=
h=20
what he had, Gonzales admitted.=20
""My basic position was that this plant was coming to San Jose. It was a=20
situation where the hand was dealt to the city of San Jose,"" Gonzales said.=
=20
As a result, Gonzales and eight of the city's nine council members reversed=
=20
field dramatically last week and voted to approve the Metcalf Energy Center=
,=20
a $400 million power plant to be built by Calpine Corp. and Bechtel=20
Enterprises Holding Inc.=20
In November, Gonzales and the council had unanimously rejected the power=20
plant proposal, contending that it was too close to the residential Santa=
=20
Teresa neighborhood, that the plant belonged in an industrial area and that=
=20
it was contrary to the city's general plan for the area.=20
All of that is still true, although the environmental problems have been=20
dramatically mitigated, Gonzales said.=20
What changed is the political atmosphere surrounding energy decisions, and=
=20
the plain reality that the decision by San Jose's officials was going to be=
=20
cast aside.=20
""It became more and more clear the California Energy Commission was going t=
o=20
overrule our decision,"" Gonzales said.=20
""Given that inevitability, I felt it was important to act upon the request =
of=20
Calpine to sit down and talk.""=20
The result, he said, is a ""different facility"" than the one the council=20
rejected in November, although there are plenty of skeptics who contend tha=
t=20
the new plant is not substantially different from the one the city rejected=
=20
eight months ago.=20
The most significant changes were in the protection of the neighborhood's a=
ir=20
quality by requiring more monitoring and stricter safety standards for the=
=20
handling of toxic chemicals.=20
The community also will have its own advisory committee overseeing the plan=
,=20
and air quality reports will be made regularly and publicly.=20
Calpine/Bechtel also agreed to cut back by 25 percent the number of times t=
he=20
facility will be shut down and restarted. Such events occur as demand ebbs=
=20
and flows, and every restart involves a period of unusually high emissions,=
=20
in much the same way that emissions rise every time a car is started.=20
But Calpine spokeswoman Lisa Poelle admitted that the demand for energy at=
=20
the new plant -- scheduled to open in mid-2003 -- is expected to be so high=
=20
that shutdowns due to a lack of demand are considered unlikely.=20
The new agreement also gives local business a spot at the head of the line =
-=20
- they have a three-month period where they're allowed to apply exclusively=
=20
for contracts for the power from the Metcalf plant.=20
""Most of the power will stay here in San Jose,"" he said.=20
Gonzales said he entered into negotiations with Calpine/Bechtel after meeti=
ng=20
with residents of the Santa Teresa neighborhood. He said he believes the=20
agreement responds to most of their concerns.=20
""Did we get everything they wanted? No. It was probably impossible to get=
=20
everything they wanted,"" he said.=20
In fact, despite all the negotiations, Gonzales is plainly disappointed tha=
t=20
he was forced to make the deal.=20
The plant ""is still inconsistent with our general plan, and that is the cru=
x=20
of the whole process. The California Energy Commission was set up to decide=
=20
if they will override a local land-use decision. . . . Land use has become =
a=20
moot issue. And when we rejected it in November, it was based on the land=
=20
use.=20
""I acted on the same principles we had from day one -- do everything I coul=
d=20
to protect the neighborhood.""=20
Gonzales steadfastly argued that he was not influenced by the array of=20
political and business interests that had lined up in support of the Metcal=
f=20
project -- including Gov. Gray Davis, every state legislator in the region=
=20
and the area's leading business and environmental organizations.=20
""The other part of the political structure has a very different job than I=
=20
have. I have the responsibility of protecting neighborhoods and the city of=
=20
San Jose,"" he said.=20
Gonzales also said he believed there would be no long-term political damage=
=20
to his bid for re-election next year.=20
His opposition to the power plant was based on his own agenda of protecting=
=20
neighborhood interests, a popular position that has guided the rest of his=
=20
activities, he said.=20
""The people of San Jose are my bosses,"" he said.=20
""I've continued to stay focused on things that were important to them in=20
1998. I said I was going to work on strong neighborhoods, traffic congestio=
n=20
and improving public education, and those are the things I've been working=

San Diegans were the first in the state to pay out of control power prices=
=20
and they will soon experience another first -- an electric rate hike impose=

by the state.=20
The California Department of Water Resources, which recently took over=20
electricity buying for the state's cash-strapped utilities, is raising San=
=20
Diego Gas & Electric rates 19 percent to collect $915 million the agency sa=
ys=20
it needs to make those purchases. The rate hike was the subject of a public=
=20
hearing Monday, where residents like Hoover had the opportunity to tell sta=
te=20
regulators how they felt about such increases.=20
Customers of SDG&E were the first to be exposed to unrestricted power price=
s=20
under the state's 1996 deregulation law, which is widely blamed for the=20

bundled rates at about 15 cents a kilowatt hour.=20
The DWR will raise rates on average by 2.77 cents per kilowatt-hour to 17.8=

SDG&E, which serves 1.2 million customers in San Diego and Orange counties,=

has a separate request to raise rates an additional 16 percent or 2.3 cents=

per kilowatt-hour, pending before the PUC. The utility says the increase=20
would raise $800 million to cover losses it incurred paying skyrocketing=20
prices of electricity before the DWR began buying power in January.=20
Typically, requests for rate increases, such as SDG&E's, goes through the=

Blackouts' first birthday is this week=20
Posted at 10:40 p.m. PDT Monday, June 11, 2001=20
BY JOHN WOOLFOLK=20

Mercury News=20


It was only a year ago that Californians scarcely considered their electric=
=20
bills, rarely thought twice before boarding elevators and never calculated=
=20
the kilowatts firing their hot tubs. For many, the biggest care last June w=
as=20
tracking portfolios on the Internet.=20
Now, if you want to follow your stocks consistently, you'd better have=20
bolstered your PC with a battery backup.=20
Sometime in the year since rolling blackouts first darkened the San Francis=
co=20
Bay Area last June 14, most Californians have gained a new obsession:=20
electricity. And though the power outlook has swung from hopeful to dreadfu=
l=20
and back again, many of us haven't lived quite the same ever since.=20
``Before, you might have the radio on all day, or the television; now, you=
=20
don't do that,'' said Doreen Hufton, 54, of Cupertino. ``We used to have=20
plug-in air fresheners. We've taken all those out now.''=20
The transformation has touched everything around us. Gov. Gray Davis, once =
an=20
all-but-certain presidential contender, is now fighting for his political=
=20
life. California wiped out its multibillion-dollar budget surplus to buy=20
power for its destitute utilities. And its economy, sixth largest in the=20
world, is threatened by troubles better-known in banana republics.=20
Beyond its borders, California has gone from admired trendsetter to a=20
national laughingstock; from political heavyweight to a beggar for mercy.=
=20
``We went from a holiday moment to a funeral,'' said Mark Petracca, a=20
political scientist at the University of California-Irvine.=20
More remarkable, Californians themselves -- full of optimism a year ago --=
=20
are now glum. Even the prospect that the crisis may ease isn't ending our=
=20
malaise, at least not yet.=20
``It's a wholesale change in attitude,'' said Field Poll director Mark=20
DiCamillo, who recently found Californians' optimism at its lowest level in=
 a=20
decade. ``This changeover from a very buoyant outlook to despairing about t=
he=20
future all happened in a very short period of time. I'd attribute almost al=
l=20
of that to problems with electricity.''=20
Lifestyle in flux=20
Even the hot tubs and white wines that, for many, epitomize California's=20
laid-back lifestyle are scrutinized over the power they demand for heating=
=20
and cooling.=20
The ``Energy Star'' label that shoppers hardly noticed a year ago is sudden=
ly=20
must-have. Local appliance and electronics stores say energy-efficient=20
washers, dryers and refrigerators fly off their shelves, along with=20
flashlights, batteries, generators and backup battery packs.=20
``It's all energy-saving -- that's all they want,'' said Pauline Lerma, a=
=20
customer service representative at Western Appliance. ``It's just boomed.''=
=20
With thermostats up this summer to save power, the state that invented casu=
al=20
Fridays is dressing down all through the week. It's more shirtsleeves and=
=20
fewer blazers at the Santa Clara County Government Center, where department=
=20
heads offer battery-powered fans to sweating staff. Even bastions of=20
formality -- the state Senate and courts, where coat and tie are standard=
=20
dress for men -- talk of loosening up.=20
California's newest residents, many of whom come from countries where power=
=20
shortages are routine, find the irony amazing.=20
``I can't believe this is happening in the richest country in the world,''=
=20
said Vandana Kumar, 37, who came to San Jose from Bihar, India, 15 years ag=
o.=20
Back in Bihar, people live with six hours of blackouts every weekday, from =
8=20
to 11 in the morning and 4 to 7 in the evening, Kumar said. Now they're=20
chuckling over California.=20
``They all know about it and it's a big joke,'' Kumar said. ``They say,=20
`Didn't you go there to get away from this?'?''=20
Kumar can take comfort in this: No one could have predicted the past year's=
=20
turn of events.=20
The June 2000 blackouts, in fact, were only partly related to the power=20
crisis they exposed, resulting mostly from record heat that overwhelmed the=
=20
Bay Area's long-inadequate transmission capacity.=20
But when nearly 100,000 customers went dark that day, the state gradually=
=20
began to notice a problem that had been building for months. Down in San=20
Diego, power prices were starting to soar.=20
The pace of change soon quickened.=20
By December state leaders were urging limits on holiday lights, natural gas=
=20
bills were skyrocketing and major utilities were nearing bankruptcy. The ne=
w=20
year brought first one electric rate increase, then another. And along the=
=20
way, the energy crisis became part of our lives.=20
California's lexicon in 2001 includes ``rolling blackout,'' ``ISO'' and=20
``outage block.'' And when Gov. Davis speaks of ``QFs'' on TV, referring to=
=20
alternative energy producers, at least some of his viewers know he means=20
qualifying facility.=20
The state's troubles have had impact far beyond its borders. Because the=20
energy crisis is widely thought to stem from California's 1996 decision to=
=20
deregulate its electricity markets, other states are fleeing the=20
once-burgeoning deregulation movement.=20
``It's dampened interest,'' said Suraj Kanhouwa, an economist with the=20
federal Energy Information Administration. ``Other states that were on the=
=20
cusp of deregulation are in a wait-and-watch mode. The California experienc=
e=20
is unfortunate, it was not anticipated, and it's raising a lot of=20
questions.''=20
Political agendas, too, have been derailed coast to coast. Gov. Davis and=
=20
President George W. Bush campaigned to reform education. Now, it's all abou=
t=20
energy, a concern that's sinking approval ratings for both. Davis, in=20
particular, seems to get more national exposure these days in the comics th=
an=20
he does on the political circuit.=20
Last week, for instance, the Pretzel Logic strip treated readers to the son=
g=20
``Proud Davis,'' to the tune of ``Proud Mary'' (``Rollin' -- rollin' -- We'=
re=20
rollin' through a blackout'').=20
``If you came to work this morning and neglected to put your pants on, you'=
d=20
be the butt of jokes,'' said state librarian Kevin Starr. ``California didn=
't=20
put its pants on.''=20
After a year of bickering and precious little progress, Democrats and=20
Republicans still talk of solving the power crisis. But many Californians=
=20

Davis' con job=20
Governor withholds truth from taxpayers about state's electricity crisis




TOM MCCLINTOCK
Senator McClintock represents the 19th Senate District in the California=20
Legislature. His website address is www.sen.ca.gov/mcclintock=20

In a free society, California's electricity problems would have corrected=
=20
themselves long ago. A shortage develops, electricity becomes relatively=20
scarce and prices rise. As prices rise, consumers reduce their demand while=
=20
producers develop more generation. Consumption declines, production=20
increases, prices fall. The result: low prices and abundant electricity.=20
In California's society, a simple shortage becomes catastrophic. As prices=
=20
rise, the government begins heavily subsidizing electricity purchases. This=
=20
drives prices still higher while hiding the reality of those prices from=20
consumers. Meanwhile, government officials threaten producers with the=20
seizure of their assets and imprisonment if they set foot in California. Th=
e=20
result: Consumers will see surcharges tacked onto their power bills and tax=
es=20
for years to come to pay for the subsidies, while investors who planned to=
=20
come to California to build more power plants decide to invest elsewhere.
There is a very simple truth that California's governor just can't seem to=
=20
grasp: Governments can hide prices, but they cannot set them. When Gov. Dav=
is=20
buys power for 50-cents per kilowatt-hour and sells it back to consumers fo=
r=20
seven cents, consumers haven't been spared the other 43 cents. It simply en=
ds=20
up on their tax bill. Already, the state's treasury has lost more than $8=
=20
billion (about $950 for an average family of four) in this manner.
To fill this growing hole in his budget, Davis approved the biggest bond=20
measure in history to be repaid with crushing surcharges on consumers' futu=
re=20
electricity bills, averaging about $2,000 per ratepayer.
To keep consumers from revolting over those surcharges, the administration =
is=20
now struggling with how to disguise them. It is doing so by tinkering with=
=20
baseline prices.=20
Different ""baselines"" for usage will be adjusted to determine who has been=
=20
virtuously frugal and should be rewarded with subsidies and who has been=20
profligate and should be punished with sky-high rates. What makes this=20
fundamentally unjust is that the question of ""fairness"" depends on an=20
infinite combination of factors that government cannot foresee.=20
It is impossible for government to account for these infinite variations in=
=20
personal circumstances and any preferential pricing scheme is bound to crea=
te=20
countless injustices.=20
There are four principles that government in a free society should instill=
=20
into the pricing structure. They are the four principles that California's=
=20
government has violated.
The first is freedom of choice. In 1996, consumers won the right to choose=
=20
the provider that offers them the best deal for electricity. Although the=
=20
state's electricity supply collapsed before those choices materialized, the=
=20
fact remains that the ultimate defense against price gouging is the ability=
=20
to take your business elsewhere. Gov. Davis and the Legislature took that=
=20

to confidential government records.
?????The 38 long-term contracts, totaling nearly $43 billion, could saddle=

declining prices represent a trend in the volatile electricity market.
?????Gov. Gray Davis in recent days has largely credited these contracts wi=
th=20
breaking the fever of the energy crisis. But the cooling prices--and fresh=
=20
details of the contracts--raise concerns that the 18 energy companies may=
=20
have gotten the better end of the deals.
?????Perhaps adding to the downward pressure on prices, senior officials of=
=20
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said Tuesday that the agency is=20
considering new ways to curb California electricity prices this summer.
?????Among other things, the commission might extend its current wholesale=
=20
price limits--now in effect only during power emergencies--to 24 hours a da=
y,=20
seven days a week.
?????The contract records obtained by The Times show that the state is=20
committed to buying power at prices up to $154 a megawatt-hour for peak=20
electricity and more than $95 for energy that includes times of day when=20
demand is lowest.
?????By contrast, with a recent tumble in wholesale power prices, the state=
=20
purchased peak daytime electricity at less than $100 an hour and less than=
=20
$20 at night when demand trails off. On Tuesday, prices for last-minute pea=
k=20
power in California were under $58 a megawatt-hour, according a Bloomberg=
=20
news service survey.
?????In some contracts, the state may pay more or less in the years ahead,=
=20
depending on the price of natural gas. Under terms negotiated by the Davis=
=20
administration, one company receives $80 million to $90 million a year simp=
ly=20
to be ready to produce, even if no electricity is sold.
?????The good news surrounding current market prices could change rapidly=
=20
this summer as temperatures climb and use of air conditioning surges.
?????Nonetheless, experts say, the recent prices could be an omen of the=20
future, when as many as 15 new power plants come online, adding thousands o=
f=20
megawatts to the California grid.
?????""The theme here is the governor embarked on a long-term strategy for a=
=20
short-term crisis,"" said Peter Navarro, an economist at UC Irvine, who=20
reviewed some of the contract terms at the request of The Times. ""They pret=

much got this exactly wrong.""
?????State officials, including Davis, say they are proud of the hard-fough=
t=20
concessions they won from the power merchants, who have reaped immense=20
profits from the state's failed deregulation scheme.
?????They say the benefits of the power contracts, while less predictable i=
n=20
the long term, have already helped alter the marketplace. Perhaps most=20
important, they say, the contracts have freed the state from a nearly total=
=20
reliance on last-minute purchases in the costly spot market.
?????Officials say the contracts have locked up nearly half the state's pea=
k=20
power needs this summer. The remainder will come from short-term contracts,=
=20
last-minute purchases and reduced demand from conservation programs. ""This=
=20
was all a well thought-through plan of action,"" said Davis energy advisor S=

David Freeman, former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power=

""The war ain't over. But we have landed on enemy territory and we are rolli=

?????Freeman seemed less confident, however, when asked whether the state m=

""=20
he said, ""we certainly don't know the future.""
?????Ray Hart, deputy director of the Department of Water Resources, said t=
he=20
state is absolutely not overpaying for power under the contracts his agency=
=20
is helping to negotiate. He acknowledged that the average price the state i=
s=20
paying under the contracts is higher than current market prices.
?????And that is the way it should be, he said, because the state has=20
dampened the volatility of the spot market by reducing last-minute purchase=
s.
?????""If we didn't have contracts,"" Hart said, ""we'd be buying 100% on the=
=20
spot market . . . spending $300-plus [a megawatt-hour] for energy.""
?????Many of the contract details remain shrouded in mystery, making it=20
difficult to gauge the true extent of the state's financial commitment.

?????News Organizations Seek Disclosure of Deals
?????The Times and other news organizations have sued the state to release=
=20
the contracts and provide details on the state's daily power purchases, now=
=20
totaling more than $7 billion. The Davis administration previously refused =
to=20
release the information, saying that it would undercut the state's efforts =
to=20
secure additional long-term contracts.
?????But on Tuesday the governor announced that he intended to release the=
=20
contracts as early as today ""with only very minor redactions.""
?????The about-face came after state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer said publicly=
=20
that the contracts should no longer be kept secret and preceded by a day a=

news organizations.=20
?????The administration sent letters to the 18 power producers and marketer=

?????In a letter to one firm, the administration said the San Diego hearing=

""may be the only such opportunity for your firm to indicate whether it has=

any objection to the public disclosure of the contract.""
?????More than one firm is likely to object.
?????""We have always maintained that there's information in the contracts=

?????""This sort of short-term fix,"" Ose said, ""has squandered our [state=20

?????The records obtained The Times show that the contracts vary widely in=

cost and complexity.
?????For example, in a series of agreements for power in Southern Californi=

the state has agreed to pay Dynegy Inc. some rates fixed at a $119 a=20

?????Under a separate deal for the same three-year period, the Houston-base=

Federal Panel May Extend Price Limits=20
Utilities: Regulatory commission weighs expanding the plan beyond emergenci=
es=20
and throughout the West.=20

By RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR, Times Staff Writer=20

?????WASHINGTON--The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, responding to=20
pressure from lawmakers, state officials and consumers, is considering a=20
significant expansion of its plan to limit California electricity prices th=
is=20
summer, senior agency officials said Tuesday.
?????Commissioners and staff members are engaged in intense negotiations in=
=20
advance of a key meeting Monday to finalize an emergency plan for Californi=
a=20
and the West.
?????According to several commission officials, the options being discussed=
=20
include:
?????* Extending FERC's current price limits--now in effect only during pow=
er=20
emergencies in California--to 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The limits=
,=20
intended to prevent price spikes, were invoked during two emergencies last=
=20
month and resulted in immediate cuts in the price of wholesale electricity.=
=20
FERC is also considering applying such limits throughout the West.
?????* Requiring power generators in the entire Western region to sell=20
available electricity to California or into their local power grids during=
=20
emergencies, reducing the threat of blackouts.
?????* Establishing a regional framework for large power users to sell=20
electricity back into the grid during peak usage times. Some companies that=
=20
have long-term power contracts at low rates may be able to make money by=20
scaling back their operations and selling electricity.
?????* Tightening rules on what energy marketers--firms that buy and resell=
=20
power contracts much like stockbrokers trade shares--can charge for their=
=20
electricity.
?????* Expanding an order issued last year that authorized refunds for=20
excessive markups during the most extreme power emergencies. That refund=20
order would now apply to excessive prices during all power emergencies.
?????The measures under consideration stop short of the price caps being=20
sought by Gov. Gray Davis and California Democrats. But they may go far=20
enough to provide an acceptable compromise.
?????""The whole thing is in flux, but it is moving toward a much more=20
effective price mitigation plan, not only for California but for the West,""=
=20
said an agency official.
?????Strong political pressure from Senate Democrats and House Republicans=
=20
appears to have galvanized FERC into taking a more decisive role. ""We're so=
rt=20
of the last to get it,"" the official said.
?????FERC has been bitterly criticized by Davis for abandoning California.=
=20
FERC Chairman Curtis L. Hebert Jr. has responded by citing dozens of modest=
=20
FERC actions to assist the state.
?????But Hebert has resisted Davis' central demand that FERC use its legal=
=20
authority to order a temporary return to fixed electricity rates. Such fixe=
d=20
rates, based on the cost of producing power plus an allowance for profit,=
=20
were standard before deregulation.
?????""The politics of the situation have changed significantly, and=20
commissioners are not immune to politics,"" said another senior agency=20
official. ""The message from Capitol Hill has gotten stronger with a=20
Democratic Senate. Even the Bush administration is saying we should make su=
re=20
there is no price gouging.""
?????FERC members have been summoned to testify before the Senate=20
Governmental Affairs Committee chaired by Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.=
)=20
a week from today. Meanwhile, Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), the new Senate=
=20
Energy Committee chairman, has told FERC he will move legislation to cap=20
electricity rates in the West unless it acts soon.
?????Agency officials said commissioners do not want to face Lieberman next=
=20
week empty-handed.
?????House Republicans have also been prodding the agency. On Tuesday, Ener=
gy=20
Committee Chairman W.J. ""Billy"" Tauzin (R-La.) wrote Hebert to urge=20
Western-wide, round-the-clock price limits.
?????""We strongly urge the commission to implement a comprehensive plan to=
=20
mitigate wholesale prices and aggressively monitor wholesale sales of=20
electric energy . . . within the entire Western Systems Coordinating=20
Council,"" wrote Tauzin, referring to the Western power grid.
?????FERC officials said a strong effort is underway to achieve a consensus=
=20
on the five-member commission, lately riven by ideology but now bolstered b=
y=20
two new pragmatic commissioners who favor active oversight of industry.
?????Commissioner William Massey, who for months has been a lonely dissente=
r,=20
is continuing to press for the traditional price caps sought by Davis,=20
officials said. Once marginalized, Massey apparently is now being actively=
=20
wooed by the other members.
?????S. David Freeman, an energy advisor to Gov. Davis, said Tuesday that=
=20
expanding FERC's current price limits would be a positive step. But he adde=
d=20
that the governor continues to advocate a return to traditional, fixed rate=
s.
?????""Any strengthening of the [FERC] plan is in the public interest,""=20
Freeman told reporters at a Washington news conference.
?????FERC's price limits are not keyed to a particular dollar amount but ar=
e=20
flexible.
?????When a power emergency is called by the state, FERC's plan limits the=
=20
price that generators can charge to what it costs to produce power at the=
=20
least efficient plant running at that time. (The costs of all the plants ar=
e=20
determined beforehand by California's grid operator based on data filed by=
=20
the generators.)
?????Another requirement of the FERC plan forces generators using the=20
California grid to sell any power they have available during emergency=20
conditions.
?????When the price limits were tested in two emergencies late last month,=
=20
prices came down quickly. But power sellers complained that the limits were=
=20
too strict. And by the second emergency, there was evidence that some selle=
rs=20
had started finding ways around the limits.

50,000 additional shares with a market value of $2.5 million, according to=

?????Indeed, the stock sales have taken place against a backdrop of acrimon=

between state officials and the power companies.
?????Last month, Lynch told The Times that state investigators have uncover=

evidence that a ""cartel"" of power companies shut down plants for unnecessar=

?????Executives at firms not accused of price gouging also have cashed in.
?????Ann B. Curtis, chief financial officer of Calpine Corp., a San=20
Jose-based power plant builder and generator, has netted more than $10=20
million in option transactions in the last year. That compares with a total=

of $5 million in the four previous years.
?????Some analysts say the transactions are to be expected, considering the=

?????""Unlike at the old-line utilities where insiders rarely sell, we've=20
grown accustomed to insider sales at the diversified power producers,"" said=

Paul Elliott, a First Call/Thomson Financial analyst. ""I'm not convinced th=

these sales raise any red flags at this point.""
?????Although no one is saying that any of the stock trades were illegal,=
=20
critics link the value of the transactions to the profits streaming out of=

California.
?????""The generators have no shame,"" said Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for=

California Gov. Gray Davis. ""It speaks to how there has been a massive=20

?????Lay, the Enron chairman, ""has given himself very generous stock option=

?????Francisco said many of the sellers at Duke continue to hold large=20
amounts of the company's stock. That also holds true for executives of the=

other firms.
?????Calpine Chief Executive Peter Cartwright, for example, sold nearly $20=

Edison Reaches Accord With Alternative Generators=20

?????About 700 of the small producers generate more than one-fourth of the=

?????The PUC ordered the utilities to begin paying the generators in late=

?????""I hear it's a good deal,"" said Joe Ronan, chairman of the Independent=

Energy Producers Assn., which has been involved in the negotiations.
?????Ronan, a Calpine vice president, said he learned the deal calls for a=

though the prices are lower than historic highs of $200 or more for=20

?????Gas-fired plants, he said, would be protected from volatility in the=

natural gas market because the price they receive will go up if a wholesale=

?????The PUC is scheduled to consider a proposal for resolving the issue=20
today at a special meeting.
?????An earlier proposal called for Edison and PG&E to make payments of 15%=

of the amount due to the small energy providers that demonstrate a need for=

?????The PUC recently deferred taking action on the order because the=20

he was unaware of the settlement and noted that Freeman was in Washington o=

switched on at the 113-acre jail last week, and they generate about 65=20
kilowatts of power, Muniz said.=20
The system will produce about 500 kilowatts, Muniz said, saving the county=

about $300,000 a year in energy costs. It will also help the jail deal with=

the expected rolling blackouts in the coming hot months. Santa Rita is not=

Aki Nakao, director of the county's general services agency, said the sun-=

WE ARE FACING a tough summer here in California. With rolling blackouts and=
=20
higher electric rates, everyone agrees that we need an energy plan.=20
But just what kind of plan is the question.=20
The oil and gas industries, who have much to gain by the energy crisis, are=
=20
pushing plans to increase energy supply via the same old ""dig-it-out-burn-i=
t-=20
up"" methods that are dirty, dangerous and won't deliver secure, affordable=
=20
energy supply to the public.=20
Unfortunately, our politicians may be listening.=20
Last month, President Bush released his energy plan that calls for building=
=20
more than 1,000 power plants; drilling on public lands; rolling back=20
clean-air standards; increasing taxpayer subsidies for coal and nuclear pow=
er=20
and reducing investments in efficiency and renewable energy.=20
Gov. Gray Davis and the state Energy Commission have already repealed=20
California's clean-air laws during Stage 3 energy emergencies, allowed gas-=
=20
fired plants to surpass clean-air quotas as long as they sell the energy to=
=20
the state, and approved 13 new fossil-fuel fired power plants. The governor=
=20
also supports building more than 13 more power plants, 28 ""emergency"" plant=
s=20
and allowing diesel generators to run during Stage 3 alerts.=20
The oil and gas industries claim that we can drill for oil, burn fossil fue=
ls=20
and generate nuclear energy in ways that don't harm the environment.=20
But look at the facts:=20
-- Although natural gas burns cleaner than oil or coal, fossil fuels are=20
dirty no matter what, emitting pollutants that create soot and smog, which=
=20
could aggravate asthma and other serious health effects. Already 600,000=20
children in the state have asthma -- more fossil-fuel pollution could make=
=20
this problem worse.=20
-- Oil drilling has permanently altered the once-pristine area around Prudh=
oe=20
Bay, Alaska. British Petroleum (BP) is responsible for the second- largest=
=20
oil spill in California history and, since 1995, has paid $47 million in=20
fines for pollution violations.=20
-- Despite safety claims, no safe way exists to deal with nuclear waste fro=
m=20
nuclear power plants.=20
-- Additionally, experts estimate that U.S. oil and natural gas supplies wi=
ll=20
run out in 30 to 50 years.=20
One might get the impression that we have no choice but to ""dig it out and=
=20
burn it up"" to meet our energy needs.=20
But is the dirty, old fossil-fuel path really the only solution to the ener=
gy=20
crisis?=20
Absolutely not.=20
With abundant sunshine, windswept plains and plenty of geothermal heat,=20
California is a perfect place to use renewable energy.=20
The Energy Commission estimates that more than 50 percent of California's=
=20
energy needs could be met through solar, wind and geothermal energy. The U.=
S.=20
Department of Energy reports that 65 percent of the United States' energy=
=20
needs could be met from tougher auto standards, conservation and renewable=
=20
energy sources.=20
For example, by making sport utility vehicles comply with current passenger=
=20
car fuel-efficiency standards, we could save as much oil found in the Arcti=
c=20
National Wildlife Refuge.=20
The state Energy Commission estimates that we currently generate less than=
=20
half of the possible geothermal power in California. The U.S. Department of=
=20
Energy estimates that we could generate twice as much electricity as we=20
produce now from wind power.=20
Renewable energy systems can be built much more quickly than fossil-fuel=20
plants -- a few weeks for rooftop solar, six months to two years for wind a=
nd=20
one to three years for geothermal.=20
The public could get vast energy savings with more focus on energy=20
efficiency. Two conservation measures that were signed by Davis this spring=
=20
-- if implemented well -- will save enough energy to eliminate ""emergency""=
=20
diesel generators and still power roughly 2 million homes.=20
This spring, the governor signed an $850 million energy conservation packag=
e=20
that included rebates for consumers who buy energy-efficient appliances and=
=20
programs to distribute energy-efficient lightbulbs.=20
Unfortunately, it is now mid-June and little has been done to implement the=
se=20
programs on a large scale, despite the program's energy-saving potential.=
=20
If we were serious about harnessing the potential of replacing 1 million=20
standard lightbulbs with compact fluorescent bulbs, for example, we could=
=20
have done any one of a number of things, including calling out the National=
=20
Guard to distribute them within a week's time. Ten percent of California's=
=20
energy is currently powered by renewable sources. Now, it is time to improv=
e=20
on that. State Sen. Byron Sher, D-Palo Alto, is sponsoring SB531, which wou=
ld=20
require that by 2010, 20 percent of California's energy come from renewable=
=20
resources, such as wind and solar power.=20
Davis should endorse Sher's bill and incorporate its elements into his ener=
gy=20
plan for California.=20
By doing this, he will send a strong message that he supports solutions to=
=20
the energy crisis that protect the public health and meet our energy needs.=

California's energy market,"" the company said in a statement.=20
The small generators are owed more than $1 billion by bankrupt Pacific Gas =

Electric and Edison.=20
In March, the PUC ordered the utilities to make payments to the qualifying=
=20
facilities for power delivered in April and beyond. Both utilities began=20
making those payments in mid-April.=20
According to the California Independent System Operator, which manages the=
=20
state's power grid, many small generators have come back online since the=
=20
beginning of May.=20
The ISO said the small generators account for about 5,800 megawatts of=20
potential power. At times earlier in the year, as much as 3,000 megawatts=
=20
have been unavailable to the state. Since May, that number has decreased to=
=20
about 400 megawatts, or what would normally be expected because of mechanic=
al=20
problems or maintenance, according to the ISO.=20
One megawatt is enough to provide power to approximately 750 homes.=20
The agreement with Edison comes the same week the utility persuaded a state=
=20
judge to consolidate about a dozen lawsuits brought against the utility by=
=20
the qualifying facilities.=20
Once a trial judge has been appointed to hear the case, Edison intends to a=

If the PUC acts Wednesday on the Edison deal, those cases could disappear.=
=20
Bloom said that if the PUC decision is not appealed, generators have agreed=
=20
to put their lawsuits on hold for 180 days.=20
""If they pay back what they owe us, the lawsuits would be dismissed and the=
=20
claims would be settled,"" Bloom said.=20
Those lawsuits have been a growing source of concern for Edison, which has=

Expanded power price caps studied=20

Under mounting criticism to ease California's power woes, federal regulator=
s=20
next week are expected to consider a major expansion of their limited price=
=20
controls, applying them around the clock and throughout the West.=20
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) will meet Monday to=20
reconsider its position on California, and an agency official confirmed tha=
t=20
the proposal to broaden the controls is on the table.=20
``The worm has turned politically,'' said the commission official, who spok=
e=20
on condition of anonymity, adding that ``we're moving toward 24-7 in=20
California'' and the Western region.=20
The proposal, supported by some Republican lawmakers, stops short of the=20
price cap that state Democratic leaders have been pushing for. State=20
officials were encouraged by the talks but remained skeptical.=20
``If they're finally for price relief, hallelujah,'' said Roger Salazar,=20
spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis. ``But the devil's in the details.''=20
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who has sponsored legislation to force the=
=20
commission to enact temporary price caps based on production costs, also=20
expressed doubts about expanding existing measures.=20
``This sounds good on the face of it, and it may well be,'' Feinstein said.=
=20
``However, this situation is ripe for manipulation.''=20
The federal commission, charged with ensuring just and reasonable wholesale=
=20
power prices, has drawn widespread criticism from Western officials who say=
=20
it has fallen down on the job and allowed electricity prices to soar.=20
In April, the commission rejected pleas for a Western price cap and instead=
=20
approved limited ``mitigation measures'' for California that apply only=20
during power shortages.=20
Those measures, which took effect May 29, base prices on the production cos=

=20

Political shift=20
Supporters say there's already evidence the measures are working, noting th=
at=20
power prices in California have plummeted in recent weeks.=20
But critics say that the recent price drop is likely to prove temporary and=
=20
that the approved measures will encourage power sales out of state.=20
Since the April order, the political landscape has shifted. The commission'=
s=20
Republican chairman, Curt Hebert, a free-market advocate who opposes price=
=20
caps, may lose his post to one of two new appointees to the panel who have=
=20
hinted at more flexibility.=20
In addition, Democrats, who generally favor price caps, have taken control =
of=20
the U.S. Senate, and support is building among Republicans for tougher=20
controls.=20
The idea of extending the commission's April order around the clock and=20
throughout the West has been floating around Washington for weeks. Rep. Dou=
g=20
Ose, R-Woodland, introduced legislation May 23 to do that, but it was=20
dismissed by Gov. Gray Davis as ``inadequate.''=20
Nonetheless, Ose and 14 other Republicans, including House Energy and=20
Commerce Committee Chairman Billy Tauzin, R-La., wrote to FERC chairman Cur=

Hebert on Tuesday urging him to expand the order.=20
``To ensure that prices are just and reasonable during the critical months=

electricity prices in western markets,'' the letter said.=20
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., the new chairman of the Senate Governmental=

reasonable electricity rates. All five commissioners and Davis will testify=

David Freeman, Davis' chief energy adviser, said that an expansion of FERC'=
s=20
April order would help but that more would still need to be done.=20
``Any strengthening of any plan is in the public interest,'' Freeman said.=
=20
``But it is not a substitute for what Gov. Davis is proposing.''=20
It was unclear Tuesday how far talks at the commission were progressing.=20
Commissioner Linda Key Breathitt said she had not had discussions with othe=
r=20
commissioners. She said she expected discussions to heat up this week as th=
e=20
commission prepares for Monday's meeting.=20
But the Los Angeles Times on Tuesday quoted two unidentified commission=20
sources as saying expanded controls would be considered.=20
The commissioners' consideration of broader price controls comes as Vice=20
President Dick Cheney dismissed price cap pleas from congressional Democrat=

``He didn't give an inch,'' said Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Palo Alto, a supporter =

Cheney repeated the administration's argument that they would not produce=

more power for the state and would only discourage producers from selling t=

the region.=20
Tuesday's meeting was the first on this issue to include Democrats.=20
``The vice president listened to countless questions and suggestions, and h=

did point out that the administration was not inclined toward price caps,''=

Feinstein said expanding existing measures may allow the administration to=

help California without appearing to give in to demands for a ``cap.''=20
``Price mitigation appears to be a way to avoid using the words `price=20

en=20

That deregulation scheme of yours? ``Harebrained,'' as a smirking Cheney=20
described it on CNN.=20
Think you guys in California can conserve your way out of your energy=20
problems? Read my lips, Bush II in effect told California when he unveiled=
=20
his national energy policy: Drill more wells. Build more power plants. Eat=
=20
less granola.=20
Want to know why else California has every reason to fear Texas? Here are=
=20
three:=20
First, our greatest fear in Texas is not earthquakes. Here, cheap oil=20
qualifies as a true natural disaster.=20
Historically, our livelihood in Texas has depended on whatever people could=
=20
take out of the ground -- this means oil, natural gas, sulfur and uranium.=
=20
This dependence has put Texas at significant odds with the rest of the=20
country.=20
Remember the last energy crisis when Jimmy Carter was president and the=20
entire East Coast feared the kinds of blackouts that California now fears?=
=20
There was so little compassion for our countrymen back then that all over=
=20
Texas, bumper stickers appeared that said: ``Freeze a Yankee in the Dark.''=
=20
The point is that when Bush says he's a compassionate conservative, you hav=
e=20
to keep in mind that in Midland -- Bush's hometown of choice -- compassion =
is=20
a relative term. It means that Bush II is too nice a guy to tell California=
ns=20
to ``Rot In the Sun,'' but he's not so compassionate that he would do=20
something truly useful -- such as limiting the price of electricity to=20
forestall summer blackouts.=20
Second, Californians should fear Bush and his merry band of Texans because =
in=20
Texas there is no concept whatsoever of the idea of ``public'' land, and ve=
ry=20
little concept of the ``public good.''=20
When Texas entered the nation, it did so as a sovereign nation, not a state=
.=20
What that meant is that Texas got to keep title to all the land that wasn't=
=20
in private hands. The federal government got nothing. The state kept it all=
.=20
And the state sold most of it as quickly as it could to private owners who=
=20
put fences around it and built vast oil and ranching empires.=20
The federal government got almost none of Texas land. What the government h=
as=20
acquired in modern times -- a national park here and there, a few military=
=20
bases -- it has paid good money for.=20
Despite Hollywood's best efforts to portray Texas as a mythic land of=20
romance, Texans have a very unromantic, realistic view of land. Land is to =
be=20
used for making money. Bring in the railroads. Plow the plains. Round up th=
e=20
cattle, and -- above all -- drill for oil so that you don't have to stumble=
=20
around in the dark, like those fuzzy-headed people in California.=20
It's difficult to exaggerate just how much importance Texans place on priva=
te=20
ownership of property. Property owners in Texas can do damn near anything=
=20
they want on their own land. They can pump all of the water they want out o=
f=20
public rivers that run in front of their land. They can -- and do -- shoot=
=20
people for trespassing.=20
In Texas there is an obligation to mind your own business -- and let everyo=
ne=20
else mind theirs. If your neighbor has an energy problem, the feeling is th=
at=20
your neighbor -- not the federal government -- better find a way to solve i=
t.=20
Finally, Californians should fear Texas because we sooooo envy you.=20
Who wouldn't envy a state that is synonymous with a dream, where imaginatio=
n=20
is valued as much as realism, where people openly pursue pleasure, where=20
mountains run down to the sea, and the climate is sublime all-year-round?=

But Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., who became chairman of the Energy and Natur=

``I hope that FERC will act more aggressively,'' Bingaman said during an=20

But he said he was prepared to move a bill out of his committee before the=

July 4 recess, similar to one offered by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.,=

At the same time, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, chaired by Sen=

In a letter to FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert on Tuesday, Rep. Billy Tauzin,=

California Gov. Gray Davis has called the FERC limits inadequate and said=

they've had little impact on prices. Tauzin, however, cited evidence that=

Davis appeared Wednesday as a San Diego superior court judge ordered the=20

Several news organizations and Republican Assemblyman Tony Strickland,=20

For months, Davis had refused to do so, saying that would hurt the state's=

Court Judge Linda B. Quinn to lift the confidentiality clauses in the 38=20

The contracts, worth almost $43 billion, could keep long-term rates=20

=20
Contract records obtained by the Los Angeles Times showed the state is=20

Wholesale prices have dropped recently, but they could rise this summer whe=

Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy=20

In essence, Borenstein said, the contracts mean California now pays its hig=

By GARY POLAKOVIC, Times Environmental Writer=20

?????Gov. Gray Davis' decision this week to relax emission controls at powe=

against smog.
?????The changes are bound to cause mischief for some California areas on t=

little extra pollution could be enough to thwart attainment of the national=

health-based ozone standards in the Bay Area, San Diego and Ventura County,=
=20
officials say.
?????Moreover, in case the governor's strategy doesn't work, he has left op=

the option of tapping the dirtiest power source available--legions of backu=
p=20
diesel generators. Those 12,000 engines would provide a few hundred more=20
megawatts, but at a terrible price for air quality, because they lack=20
controls and can spew about 10 times more pollutants than the very dirty=20
""peakers"" that Davis exempted from emissions controls Monday.
?????""We're trying to make the best of a bad thing, but in the short term, =

County Air Pollution Control District.
?????Across most of Southern California, however, the energy crisis is not=
=20
likely to lead to dirtier air this year, air quality officials say.
?????The reason is that California's power plants, some of the cleanest in=
=20
the nation, contribute just 5% of the smog-forming emissions during summer=
=20
and half as much the rest of the year. The lion's share of the Southland's=

air pollution comes from cars and trucks. Two-thirds of the 16 power plants=

=20
summer, according to the South Coast Air Quality Management District, which=
=20
regulates air pollution in Los Angeles, Orange and parts of Riverside and S=
an=20
Bernardino counties.
?????Those improvements should reduce overall power plant emissions about a=

third this year, although pollution from individual generators may be highe=
r,=20
according to the state Air Resources Board.=20
?????For the most part, California air quality officials say the challenges=

=20
program to tame it, although progress toward a healthy environment is still=

?????On the other hand, officials are attempting to balance the need for a=
=20
clean environment with the need to keep the economy humming. The power=20
crisis, too, can be hazardous to people when blackouts knock out traffic=20
signals or cause heavy equipment to malfunction in the workplace.=20
?????An executive order that Davis issued Monday lifts emissions limits on=
=20
heavily polluting power plants, allowing municipalities and energy companie=
s=20
to produce as much power, and smog, as necessary.
?????The decision was reached after utilities such as the Los Angeles=20
Department of Water and Power noted that operating restrictions on so-calle=
d=20
""peaker"" plants were leaving hundreds of megawatts of capacity unused.=20
Peakers are typically run by gas-fired turbines, similar to jet engines. Th=

strictly controlled in the first place.
?????Under the governor's plan, power producers will pay $15,000 per ton of=
=20
extra smog produced by the turbines. The money will go into a fund to pay f=
or=20
cleaning up dirty trucks, buses, boats and farm equipment to offset the=20
pollution from the power plants. Government estimates show that the plan=20
could provide up to 1,200 megawatts of additional electricity, but an=20
additional 500 tons of pollutants this summer.
?????Meanwhile, emissions from cars, trucks, buses and consumer products=20
continue to decline. Air quality is dramatically better today in the=20
Southland than it was a decade ago. Credit rigorous controls on everything=
=20
from lighter fluid to paint, oil refineries to autos, bakeries to landfills=
.
?????The trend of improving air quality should accelerate as power companie=
s=20
pay the millions of dollars in fees and penalties to help fund smog-cutting=

programs. The funds will be used to switch vehicles, farm equipment and boa=

to clean fuels, many of which can be converted this year to help offset pow=

plant emissions, said Catherine Witherspoon, policy advisor for the state a=
ir=20
board.
?????""On the whole, there's not going to be a lot more smog. We expect=20
declining emissions from power plants,"" Witherspoon said.
?????Across Southern California, power plant emissions are up this year whi=
le=20
smog levels remain largely unchanged. Boilers and turbines have released mo=

anywhere in the region so far this year. The peak ozone reading has been 0.=
18=20
parts per million, a level comparable to last year's, said Joe Cassmassi,=
=20
senior meteorologist for the AQMD.
?????Smog levels are strongly influenced by weather, and in the approaching=

summer ozone season, Cassmassi said, conditions this year should be no wors=
e=20

Gulf of California will bring unsettled air, which tends to reduce smog. He=

said that by year's end the region can expect a gradual return to El Ni=0Fo=

conditions, which portends an early end to smog season.
?????""The way the weather is lining up, it will be a typical year in a=20
long-term trend and the trend is toward improving air quality,"" he said.
?????The increased emissions from power plants, however, might be just enou=

are racing against Clean Air Act deadlines that, if not met, could trigger=

federal sanctions and restrictions on highway funds.
?????""If we can make it through November without having two more violations=

County Air Pollution Control District. ""That means the air quality is not=

?????The margin is even closer in Ventura County, which was once one of the=

State Still Seeks to Veil Portions of Power Pacts=20

ts.
?????Attorneys for several news organizations and Republican state=20
legislators accused the governor's attorneys of stalling and making the iss=

needlessly complex.
?????On Tuesday, Davis dropped his earlier opposition to making long-term=

?????But Deputy Atty. Gen. Tim Muscat, representing Davis, asked Superior=

Court Judge Linda Quinn for two weeks to prepare redacted versions of the 3=

long-term contracts that total nearly $43 billion.
?????Opposing attorneys, who had sued to make the contracts public,=20
complained that the facts that Davis wants to keep secret are key to=20
understanding the contracts and to determining whether the governor has=20

?????""They've conceded the public interest [in disclosure] and no matter ho=

Sacramento attorney Charles Bell, representing 10 legislators who assert th=

keeping the contracts secret violates the California Public Records Act.
?????Quinn ruled that the long-term contracts must be made public by noon=

?????She expressed annoyance at the slow pace of negotiations between the t=

?????""This is an amazing situation,"" Quinn said.

he had only recently learned that the contracts might become public. ""All w=

The Environmental Protection Agency turned down Calfifornia's request for a=
=20
waiver of a clean-air law yesterday, forcing the state to begin using ethan=
ol=20
in gasoline as it phases out another additive that has polluted groundwater=
.=20
State officials have argued that ethanol, which reduces smog-producing=20
chemicals, is not needed to meet the state's air pollution requirements.=20
Gov. Gray Davis reacted angrily to the EPA's decision, saying it would rais=
e=20
gas prices significantly and expose the state to shortages.=20
""Their refusal will probably cost Californians 50 cents a gallon at the=20
pump,"" Davis said yesterday while visiting a community health center in San=
=20
Francisco. ""It will do nothing to clean up the air, and it is the triumph o=
f=20
politics over good science.=20
""The consumers of California once again get the shaft. The Bush=20
administration once again sides with special interests. I'm not going to ta=
ke=20
it.""=20
The EPA's denial is the latest sign of friction between the White House and=
=20
Davis, who have been battling over electricity prices.=20
The California Energy Commission estimates that consumers will pay $450=20
million more a year for gasoline if refineries have to convert to ethanol.=
=20
That translates to an increase of 3 to 6 cents for each gallon of gas.=20
If ethanol supplies are inadequate or if refineries encounter problems,=20
consumers could see gas shortages and price spikes as high as 50 cent a=20
gallon, according to the commission.=20
But EPA Administrator Christie Whitman said that the state had failed to sh=
ow=20
that a waiver of a federal Clean Air Act provision would not reduce air=20
quality. The law requires regions of the country with the worst air to use=
=20
oxygen additives in gas to reduce smog.=20
California requested the waiver because it is phasing out the additive MTBE=
,=20
or methyl tertiary butyl ether, which has polluted groundwater throughout t=
he=20
state. Ethanol is the only other additive approved under the federal Clean=
=20
Air Act.=20
DIFFICULTIES ADMITTED
Whitman acknowledged that California faced a dilemma in keeping MTBE out of=
=20
its drinking water while satisfying the federal law. However, she said,=20
oxygen- adding substances such as MTBE and ethanol in gasoline do reduce=20
smog-forming chemicals and should be used in urban areas with the worst air=
=20
quality.=20
MTBE DILEMMA
""The administration is concerned about the risks of MTBE in drinking water =
in=20
California and other states,"" Whitman said. ""Clean air and clean water are=
=20
equally important. We do not want to pursue one at the expense of the other=
.""=20
Since the widespread use of MTBE in 1997, it has become a major problem in=
=20
California and other states, tainting groundwater and threatening the=20
drinking water supplies of some areas.=20
Winston Hickox, secretary of the California EPA, said yesterday that the=20
planned ban might be delayed if the state Energy Commission decided there=
=20
were unsurmountable problems with converting to ethanol. But he didn't=20
believe California would back off on its efforts to rid gas of MTBE.=20
Sen. Dianne Feinstein yesterday accused President Bush of turning ""a blind=
=20
eye to California,"" and Sen. Barbara Boxer said the decision was another=20
example of Bush's insensitivity to Californians. Feinstein has introduced a=
=20
bill that would give governors the authority to waive the additive=20
requirement if their gas met other standards.=20
OIL INDUSTRY DISMAYED
Oil industry officials in California, who have argued that refiners could=
=20
make an additive-free gas that qualified with federal and state requirement=
s=20
to reduce smog, also said they were disappointed with the decision.=20
""Over the last four years, we've made more than 2 billion gallons of=20
cleaner-burning gas that had no added oxygen -- no MTBE, no ethanol,"" said=
=20
Fred Gorell, spokesman for Chevron Corp. ""The gas meets all the requirement=
s.=20
But we can't sell it in Southern California and Sacramento because of the=
=20
federal requirement.""=20
BOON TO FARMERS
If MTBE is banned in 2003, and there's an oxygen additive requirement, ther=
e=20
would be no other choice than to use ethanol, Gorell said.=20
Ethanol is made primarily from corn, and the EPA decision is a boon to=20
Midwestern corn growers and lawmakers from states such as Illinois, Iowa,=
=20
Minnesota and South Dakota, who had lobbied the Bush administration heavily=
=20
to deny the waiver. The decision would create a substantial market for=20
ethanol.=20
According to the Renewable Fuels Association, an ethanol industry group,=20
California would need about 580 million gallons a year to use as an additiv=
e=20
in gas. In 2001, the industry expects to produce 2.1 billion gallons, and i=
s=20
gearing up to make 300 million gallons more with the addition of 34 plants.=
=20
BIG INITIAL COSTS
Adding ethanol to California's gas supply would require a major investment =
in=20
infrastructure, Gorell said. Some of the costs would go to modify refinerie=
s=20
as well as terminals where the ethanol blending would be done.=20
Costs of transporting ethanol from Midwestern states would not be the bigge=
st=20
problem, Gorell said. Ethanol can be brought by ships and barges, just as=
=20
most of the MTBE is brought now. Ethanol also can be brought by railcars,=
=20
which are prohibited from carrying MTBE.=20
But refiners can work with ethanol, he said. Even if the waiver were grante=
d,=20
there would a new market for ethanol in Los Angeles to combat carbon monoxi=
de=20
in the winter anyway.=20
Environmental groups welcomed the EPA's decision yesterday. Bluewater Netwo=

Davis and his advisers said they have signed enough contracts that releasin=

Court dismisses suit alleging gasoline price-fixing

SAN FRANCISCO -- The California Supreme Court dismissed a class-action suit=
=20
Thursday alleging major oil refineries colluded to gouge consumers for=20
cleaner-burning gasoline.=20

The unanimous court said the suit did not provide enough evidence to suppor=
t=20
allegations that nine major oil companies in California conspired to limit=
=20
supply and fix prices.=20

In ruling that the case cannot go to trial, Justice Stanley Mosk said that=
=20
the 1996 suit presented evidence that the petroleum companies may have=20
possessed the motive, opportunity and means to unlawfully conspire.=20

""But that is all. That is not enough,"" Mosk wrote for the court.=20

The suit alleged that the state's largest refiners decided to share=20
confidential information and hold back on supplies of reformulated gasoline=
=20
after the state required refiners to make gasoline that would not create as=
=20
much pollution as previous formulas.=20

The case was granted class action status in 1997. The following year, a San=
=20
Diego County judge tossed out the case, siding with the oil companies who=
=20
said evidence was insufficient to persuade a jury.=20

Then, that judge, David Danielsen, reversed his own decision. The companies=

appealed and in January 2000, an appeals court concurred with the judge's=

?????DWP is looking to beef up its investigation staff, which totals six=20

legitimate businesses and rich people do it too.
?????The DWP once nabbed an L.A. stockbroker who siphoned $9,000 worth of=

?????WASHINGTON--The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is clearly heedin=

external politics as it prepares for a larger role in California's power=20
crisis, but the biggest catalyst for change may be within its walls.
?????On the outside, a new Democrat-controlled Senate and powerful=20
Republicans in the House have been clamoring for more assertive interventio=
n.
?????But inside, two pragmatists recently appointed by President Bush to=20
FERC's five-member governing board have already compromised the laissez-fai=
re=20
course that Chairman Curtis L. Hebert Jr. had set for the small, insular=20
agency.
?????FERC's new power crisis policy, to be unveiled at a special board=20
meeting Monday, is expected to move closer to the fixed price caps sought b=
y=20
California leaders. FERC's version would allow electricity prices in the We=
st=20
to move up and down significantly but with upper limits.
?????However, the plan was still a subject of intense internal debate=20
Thursday at FERC. Even after its expected approval by the FERC board, it mu=

survive additional rounds of political and technical vetting by other key=
=20
players in the power crisis.
?????As California has already learned, tinkering with power markets is no=
=20
easy task, and today's solutions can swiftly turn into tomorrow's unintende=
d=20
consequences.
?????For Hebert, 38, a proud Mississippian and avid free-market advocate,=
=20
growing impatience with FERC on Capitol Hill is not the only problem. He=20
risks losing a working majority on his own commission if the two new member=
s=20
ally themselves with dissenter William L. Massey in favor of stronger=20
intervention. That would isolate and embarrass Hebert, who is already in a=
=20
difficult spot because of persistent rumors that Bush will replace him as=
=20
chairman with newly appointed Commissioner Patrick H. Wood III.
?????""What we see here is someone who is a strong noninterventionist=20
Republican who has found himself in a position where he has to abandon that=
=20
to some extent,"" said James J. Hoecker, immediate past FERC chairman in the=
=20
Clinton administration. ""Chairman Hebert . . . doesn't have to be a=20
weatherman to know which way the wind is blowing.""
?????FERC, which functions like a national public utility commission, is=20
charged by law with assuring ""just and reasonable"" rates for wholesale=20
electricity. Last year, the commission made a formal finding that prices in=
=20
California were neither. But the modest ""price mitigation"" measures it=20
adopted were widely criticized as mere nibbling around the edges.
?????Not so, says Hebert. ""I don't think there is any doubt that the=20
commission's plan is working and is bringing down prices,"" he told reporter=
s=20
this week. He condemned what he called ""the ideology of price caps.""
?????The two new FERC members, Wood and Nora M. Brownell, have not offered=
=20
ringing endorsements of FERC's actions to date. During Senate confirmation=
=20
hearings last month, they indicated they favored closer, tighter scrutiny o=
f=20
industry. Wood, past chairman of the Texas Public Utility Commission and a=
=20
confidant of the president, signaled in interviews that a return to=20
regulation would be preferable to dysfunctional markets that deprive=20
consumers of the benefits of competition.
?????""No tool is off the table, even if it's a bad tool,"" Wood told the PBS=
=20
program ""Frontline.""
?????The two newcomers sounded more like Massey, the commission's lone=20
in-house critic, than like Hebert, the market purist. In April, when the=20
commission first adopted price limits, Massey pointed out flaws that FERC n=
ow=20
seems poised to address.
?????For one, he said, the limits only applied during power emergencies. ""T=
he=20
evidence is persuasive that the problem [of unfair prices] exists 24 hours =
a=20
day, seven days a week,"" Massey said. ""I have no confidence that prices wil=
l=20
be just and reasonable during all hours.""
?????Massey's view was voiced by many others as Wood prepared to assume his=
=20
new job on the panel. Wood told The Times in an interview that he heard=20
complaints from Republicans as well as Democrats.
?????Prominent among the Republicans demanding more aggressive action by FE=
RC=20
is Rep. Doug Ose of Sacramento, author of a bill calling for round-the-cloc=
k=20
price limits throughout the West.
?????Massey was no longer a voice in the wilderness.=20
?????In fact, how he votes and what he says Monday will be closely watched =
on=20
Capitol Hill and in California, particularly by Democrats looking for an=20
early signal of the plan's credibility. ""His viewpoint is considered very=
=20
highly,"" said Howard Gantman, a spokesman for Sen. Dianne Feinstein=20
(D-Calif.).
?????As Massey's stock rose, Hebert's portfolio was in growing jeopardy.

State Objects to Power Pricing Formula=20
Energy: Air quality officials say generators can boost profits by increasin=
g=20
pollution.
By GARY POLAKOVIC and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, Times Staff Writers=20
?????SACRAMENTO--California air quality officials charged on Thursday that =
a=20
federal order to contain electricity prices is vulnerable to manipulation a=
nd=20
creates powerful incentives for energy companies to increase pollution to=
=20
boost profits.
?????The order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which took effe=
ct=20
May 29, places a limit on how much generators can charge when the state's=
=20
electricity reserves are depleted. The price is based in part on the maximu=
m=20
cost incurred by any of them to generate a megawatt of electricity.
?????State clean-air officials object to that pricing formula. In addition =
to=20
fuel and labor costs, power companies can include prices paid for air=20
pollution credits, as well as the penalties and fees assessed for producing=
=20
excessive emissions from power plants running to keep the lights on.
?????Air quality officials are concerned that may entice companies to=20
manipulate the price of the credits in order to inflate their overall base=
=20
costs, thereby raising the profit bar for everyone. The issue is crucial,=
=20
because FERC is scheduled Monday to consider expanding the price limits to=
=20
all time periods.
?????""Nobody else that we can figure out would benefit from this"" but power=

generators, said Barbara Baird, legal counsel for the South Coast Air Quali=

Management District. ""The power companies would all be able to recover that=
=20
cost, regardless of whether they actually incurred that cost.""=20
?????Ironically, power plants no longer are required to buy and sell credit=
s=20
to exceed the standards after Gov. Gray Davis granted them special relief=
=20
earlier this year. Nonetheless, power companies, among others, continue to=
=20
actively trade the credits on the open market. That practice, air quality=
=20
officials say, is driving up the costs of the credits and making it harder=
=20
for other industries to buy them.
?????Because of increased electricity generation, the price of pollution=20
credits traded in the Los Angeles region has risen astronomically in the pa=
st=20
year. Credits that traded for about 25 cents per pound of pollution a few=
=20
years ago now fetch roughly $40 per pound.
?????Mike Scheible, deputy executive officer for the state Air Resources=20
Board, says the federal order also creates incentives for generators to use=

high-polluting equipment, which is more expensive to operate, in order to=

boost the amount they can charge for electricity when rate limits affect=20
pricing.
?????""It's unfair to make California ratepayers pay more for electricity to=
=20
mitigate their emissions. It doesn't pass the straight-face test for being=
=20
fair,"" Scheible said.
?????Since California power prices began to escalate last year, third parti=

Thursday.=20
?????Carol Coy, deputy executive officer at the AQMD, said one company,=20

?????Company spokesman Alan Bunnell said the transaction was perfectly lega=
l=20
and not dissimilar from other trades that routinely occur in the emissions=

trading market.
?????But state Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), chairman of the Senate select=
=20
committee inquiring into the matter, said wholesalers often blame the cost =

the credits in part for the high price of electricity. He said he is=20
concerned that there has been ""a laundering of NOx [nitrogen oxide] credits=

that's driving up the cost of both the credits and electricity. Nitrogen=20
oxide is a smog-forming gas caused by fuel combustion.
?????""It actually would be beneficial for energy companies to have those=20

?????Air quality officials aired their objections on Thursday before Dunn's=

Dabhol lenders to vote today on PPA PPPPA termination

Copyright (c) Business Standard

The 25-odd lenders to the Dabhol power project will vote today on whether the 
Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) should be allowed to to serve a 
preliminary PPA termination notice to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board 
(MSEB). The voting will take place through conference calls criss-crossing 
the globe at 6.30 pm, Indian Standard Time. Even though the three Indian 
lenders_ the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), the State Bank of 
India (SBI) and ICICI_ have decided to vote against the proposition, they 
will not be able to block the move.
Technically, the proposal can be passed if four per cent of lenders are in 
favour of the termination notice. In effect, it will be passed if one of the 
25 lenders casts its vote in favour of it. So, it's almost a foregone 
conclusion that DPC will be asked to issue its termination notice. 
Multilateral agency J-Exim, which has provided guarantees, will not 
participate in the exercise. Barring J-Exim, other financial intermediaries 
including global arrangers ABN Amro, Citi, ANZIB, CSFB and other banks and 
OPIC will cast their votes tomorrow. ""In the first round, Indian lenders put 
their foot down and refused to give clearance to the termination notice. 
Thistime around they will not be able to block the move any more. The Indian 
lenders alone cannot save the controversial $3 billion as some of the foreign 
lenders are in favour of issuing the termination notice,"" said a source. The 
Indian lenders are in favour of completing the project without any time and 
cost over-run. They have disbursed about 80 per cent of their Rs 1,500 crore 
worth of loan commitments to phase II of the project, 93 per cent of which is 
complete. The trial run is expected to commence in June. The board of the 
Dabhol Power Company has already authorised Enron India managing director, K 
Wade Cline, to serve a termination notice as and when he deems fit. At a 
meeting of the lenders last month in London, the foreign lenders were keen 
that the termination notice be served in the face of defaults by the 
Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and the Union government's refusal 
to honour the counter-guarantee of Rs 102 crore for the December bill. The 
domestic lenders are not covered by the counter-guarantee if the contract is 
terminated. The foreign lenders are covered by the counter-guarantee.

SAO PAULO (AFX) - Enron Corp will suspend investments of 600 mln usd in the 
Brazilian energy sector, news agency JB Online quoted Enron vice-president 
and Eletricidade e Servicos SA Elektro chairman Orlando Gonzales as saying. 
Of the total investment, 500 mln usd was to be assigned to the expansion of 
the thermoelectric plant Cuiaba II in the state of Mato Grosso, and in the 
construction of Rogen in the state of Rio de Janeiro, with the remainder to 
be invested in unit Elektro, it said.

USA: Sempra unit to boost natgas delivery to California.

05/15/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SAN FRANCISCO, May 15 (Reuters) - Southern California Gas Co. (SCG) said in a 
statement on Tuesday it will add around 200 million cubic feet a day, or 
about six percent, to its pipeline system by the end of the year in order to 
meet the surge in demand for gas-fired power generation. 
Today's announcement comes two months after SCG, a unit of Sempra Energy , 
proposed to increase capacity on its system by 175 mmcfd, or five percent.
Both projects will add around 11 percent of new gas capacity to its 
transmission system this year, the company said in a statement. 
In its latest proposal, called the Kramer Junction Interconnect, SCG said it 
would build a 32-mile pipeline link to the Kern-Mojave pipeline system that 
will allow it to deliver around 200 mmcfd into its system. 
The new capacity would be enough to drive three 500-megawatt power plants or 
enough gas to serve 1.4 million residential customers a day, the statement 
said. 
SCG, the nation's largest gas utility with more 18 million consumers in 
central and Southern California, said utilization of its intrastate 
transmission system in the past nine months had jumped from 75 percent to 
over 95 percent, due largely to the rise in gas-fired power generation. 
The company's announcement is the latest in several proposals to expand gas 
pipeline capacity to California, where demand for gas is expected to jump 
because of the number of gas-fired power plants being built or scheduled for 
construction. 
Gas is already used to generate about a third of California's electricity. 
And since April 1999, the state has approved 13 major gas-fired power plant 
projects with a combined generation capacity of more than 8,900 megawatts. 
Nine gas-fired power plants, with a total generation capacity of more than 
6,000 megawatts, are under construction. 
Over the past two months plans to build or expand gas lines serving 
California have been announced by Enron unit Transwestern, Williams Cos' Kern 
River Transmission, El Paso Corp. units El Paso Natural Gas Co. and Mohave 
Pipeline Co., Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. unit National Energy Group, 
Questar Corp. , Calpine Corp. , and Kinder Morgan .

Enron Urges Reforms In Japan Electricity Market-Nikkei

05/15/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

TOKYO (Nikkei)--Asserting that cuts in electricity prices will help Japanese 
companies save as much as Y4 trillion, major U.S. energy firm Enron Corp. 
(ENE) on Tuesday urged Japanese power firms to revamp the electricity market 
by separating operations such as power generation, transmission and 
distribution, The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported. 
Enron's 10-point proposal also calls for the construction of more power 
plants and full-scale deregulation of retail electricity, including sales to 
households. If such measures are carried out and electricity prices fall to 
match the levels of other industrialized nations, Japan's industrial sector 
could trim its costs by Y4 trillion, Enron said.
At a seminar on power industry deregulation hosted by Enron, the company 
asserted that Japan's deregulation in such areas as wholesale electricity 
auctions in 1996 and bulk retail sales last year has not brought significant 
benefits to end-users. 
New suppliers entering the market only account for a combined 0.4% of the 
entire electricity sector, Enron said, criticizing the fact that power plant 
facilities are mainly concentrated among electric power companies. 
Regarding prices, an official representing operators of power generation 
facilities asserted that ""industrial-use electricity prices in Japan are 
stuck at a high level at around Y13 per kilowatt, compared with Y5 in the 
U.S., Y3 in Canada, Y9 in Germany and Y4-Y8 in Southeast Asia."" 
In fact, department store operator Takashimaya Co. (8233 or J.TKA), which 
last November switched to new market entrants for part of its electricity 
supply, was able to cut costs by Y450 million in the first year, said a 
company official. 
Enron hopes to generate competition by urging Japanese electric utilities to 
spin off different operations, analysts say. If the number of power 
generation facility operators increases, this will help bolster Japan's 
electricity trading market, an area in which Enron has a strong business 
interest. 
Splitting electricity operations into generation, transmission and 
distribution is expected to open the electric utility network to new 
entrants. This will boost transparency in the fees that electric power 
companies charge for transmitting power on behalf of the operators of power 
generation facilities, Enron says. 
Citing the power shortage in California, however, Japan's electricity sector 
has strongly opposed such spin-offs, stating that generation and distribution 
must be part of a single continuum to ensure a stable supply.

Enron Agrees to Provide Market Data to NGX

05/15/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

CALGARY, May 15 /PRNewswire/ - NGX Canada Inc. (NGX), a wholly owned 
subsidiary of OM AB (OM), today announced that an arrangement has been made 
with Enron Canada Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. (Enron), 
whereby trading data from certain contracts listed on Enron's online trading 
system, EnronOnline will be included in the computation of three Alberta Gas 
Price Indices. 
NGX acquired the AECO ""C"" & NIT Daily Spot, One-Month Spot, and Bid-Week Spot 
gas price indices (Alberta Gas Price Indices) from Canadian Enerdata Ltd. 
last September. Subsequent to the acquisition of the Alberta Gas Price 
Indices, NGX has provided real-time information to its customers on the 
establishment of the weighted average price indices based on transactions 
conducted through NGX's trading system. Canadian Enerdata Limited continues 
to publish the Alberta Gas Price Indices in the Canadian Gas Price Reporter.
Peter Krenkel, President of NGX, stated, ""We believe that inclusion of data 
from EnronOnline will serve to make our price indices among the best in North 
America. The industry has been very supportive of the visibility and 
integrity we are able to bring to the Alberta Gas Price Indices, which 
removes the guesswork around gas price index methodology. However, after 
reviewing the matter with Enron and other industry participants, we 
recognized that Enron had legitimate concerns and the industry felt that 
""more is better"". The inclusion of data from the highly liquid EnronOnline 
system should improve the quality of our price indices even further."" 
Rob Milnthorp, President and CEO of Enron Canada commented, ""We are very 
pleased to have EnronOnline transactions included in the Alberta Gas Price 
Indices. This will provide industry participants with a more comprehensive 
source of data and a better opportunity to manage risk around these price 
indices as they are now assured that all their transactions on EnronOnline 
will be included in the computation of the Alberta Price Indices."" 
The inclusion of EnronOnline data satisfies the principal claims made by 
Enron in their legal action against NGX, Canadian Enerdata Ltd., OM and 
Richard Zarzeczny and Enron has agreed to discontinue the legal action 
against those parties with the conclusion of this arrangement. 
NGX and Enron are planning to implement the necessary system changes by 
August 1, 2001 but in any event will provide at least thirty days notice to 
the industry. Once in operation, data from transactions in the relevant 
contracts listed on EnronOnline will be fed to NGX in real-time. The 
methodology for computing the Alberta Gas Price Indices will continue to be 
on a weighted-average basis. 
NGX will engage independent auditors to insure full compliance with the Index 
Methodology Guide. This guide is available on NGX's website at www.ngx.com.

UAE To Seek New Partners If Enron Exits Dolphin Gas Proj

05/15/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- If U.S.-based Enron Corp. (ENE) pulls out of the $3.5 
billion Dolphin gas project, in which the company holds a 24.5% stake, the 
U.A.E. Offsets Group, or UOG, will consider other companies to replace it, a 
United Arab Emirates industry source close to the project said Tuesday. 
Industry sources Monday said Enron is considering withdrawing from the 
project because it doesn't believe it will be profitable.
Dolphin, an agreement signed two years ago by UOG and Qatar Petroleum, plans 
to bring 2 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from Qatar's offshore 
North Field to Abu Dhabi and onward to Dubai. 
Enron and TotalFinaElf (TOT) each hold a 24.5% stake in the project, while 
UOG owns the remaining 51%. 
Enron is set to focus on the midstream part of the project - gas 
transportation - which requires building a 350-kilometer pipeline from a 
processing plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar, to the Taweelah terminal in Abu Dhabi 
and the Jebel Ali terminal in Dubai. 
The U.A.E. source said originally, it was thought that the U.A.E. government 
would fund the pipeline, which is estimated to cost around $1 billion. 
However, more recently, the source said the U.A.E. suggested that Enron put 
up the money itself. 
Other industry sources said Enron and TotalFinaElf also had to pay 
significant fees to join the project. TotalFinaElf will
operate the upstream part of the project, which includes developing
natural gas reserves in two blocks of the North Field. First wells are 
scheduled to be drilled in the second half of 2001 and come onstream in 
2005. 

Last week, the Middle East Economic Survey reported that the foreign partners 
haven't yet agreed on the precise details of their working relationship or on 
the price of the pipeline. 
Qatar Petroleum and Dolphin Energy Ltd., a subsidiary of UOG, signed an 
initial agreement in March for the upstream section of the project. A full 
agreement is expected to be concluded in September, the source said.

Enron Should Sell Utility to Oregon, Lawmaker Argues (Update2)

Enron Should Sell Utility to Oregon, Lawmaker Argues (Update2)

     (Updates with closing share prices.)

     Washington, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. should sell
Portland General Electric Co. to Oregon so state consumers can be
insulated from soaring electricity prices, a congressman said.
     ``Purchasing PGE would give Oregon ratepayers more control by
keeping its assets in Oregon, accountable solely to Oregonians,''
U.S. Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat from Springfield,
Oregon, said in a letter to Governor John Kitzhaber.
     The governor is considering DeFazio's proposal, said
Kitzhaber spokesman Kevin Smith.
     Last month, Houston-based Enron, the biggest energy trader,
agreed to cancel the $3.1 billion sale of Portland General, a
utility with more than 700,000 Oregon customers, to Sierra Pacific
Resources of Reno, Nevada.
     Enron and Sierra Pacific blamed laws spawned by high power
prices and electricity shortages in the West for the sale's
collapse.
     ``We are pleased to keep Portland General in our asset
portfolio because it's a solid earnings performer,'' Enron
spokeswoman Karen Denne said. ``If approached by a buyer who
recognizes its value, we'd consider selling it.'' She declined to
comment on a potential bid by Oregon.
     The state should act swiftly, DeFazio said, citing press
reports that the U.K.'s Scottish Power Plc, owner of PacifiCorp,
the largest utility in the U.S Northwest, may bid for Portland
General.
     Scottish Power, based in Glasgow, Scotland, would have more
than 70 percent of Oregon electricity customers if it added
Portland General, raising ``serious regulatory concerns about
market power,'' he said.

                            Bond Issue

     Oregon could issue bonds to purchase Portland General, using
the utility's profits to pay the debt, DeFazio said. The state
might run it as a public utility or a cooperative, he said.
     Enron and Sierra Pacific called off the Portland General sale
because of laws passed by Nevada and California legislators that
slow the deregulation of their wholesale power markets.
     California and Nevada have blocked sales of power plants by
utilities. Sierra Pacific had to sell a stake in a Nevada power
plant that sells power to California to win regulatory approval of
the Portland General purchase.
     Average power prices on the California-Oregon border this
year have soared ninefold to $296.34 a megawatt hour over the year-
earlier period. A megawatt hour can light 750 average California
homes for an hour.
     Shares of Enron fell $1.76 to $$56.99. They've fallen 31
percent this year.
     Sierra Pacific rose 9 cents to $16.09. Scottish Power rose 9
pence to 492 ($7) in London.



Enron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1)

Enron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1)

     (Adds closing share price.)

     Houston, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's
biggest energy trader, agreed to provide natural-gas pricing
information to NGX Canada Inc. and drop a C$100 million
($64.7 million) suit against the Canadian gas exchange.
     Enron sued NGX in November after the Internet exchange, a
unit of the company that owns the Stockholm Stock Exchange,
changed providers of its gas-pricing data and didn't include
trades on EnronOnline, Enron's Internet exchange, when calculating
gas-price indexes.
     Calgary-based NGX agreed to include EnronOnline trades in
calculating its Alberta Gas Price Indices by August, Enron
spokesman Eric Thode said.
     NGX, owned by Stockholm's OM Gruppen AB, is used by about 90
percent of Canadian gas traders, and many traders use EnronOnline
to sell gas from western Canada, the biggest supplier of the
cleaner-burning fuel to the U.S.

Hawk vote for California firm unanimous 
Montgomery Watson pegged for water plant 
By MARY FLOOD 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
The Houston Area Water Corp. voted unanimously Monday to grant a $92 million 
contract to a California-based firm to design, build and operate a Lake 
Houston water plant. 
City Council soon will receive the contract for its approval. The 
administration of Mayor Lee Brown was believed to have favored Montgomery 
Watson's chief competitor, Azurix Corp., an arm of local energy giant Enron 
Corp. 
The water corporation, known as ""the Hawk,"" voted 5-0 to grant the contract. 
If approved by City Council, the contract would give the company 2 1/2 years 
to get the plant up and treating raw lake water. 
It was initially expected that the plant, which will be designed to handle 40 
million gallons of water daily, could cost as much as $150 million to build. 
The Hawk board asked the vying companies to modify their bids several times, 
and that caused the competitors to lower their prices. 
The contract calls for the Hawk to pay a monthly operating fee of $157,000 
when the plant is working. And Montgomery Watson could be required to 
construct, at the Hawk's option, an additional 40 million-gallon-a-day plant 
expansion for $32 million. 
But the details of how the plant will be financed have not been determined. 
The Hawk board discussed borrowing money using the city's credit rating on a 
short-term basis until it could develop long-term financing by selling bonds 
itself. 
The initial customer for the water is the city of Houston, which would repay 
the Hawk the cost of producing the treated water. The hope is that the plant 
eventually will provide water to other entities in the area as well. This 
plant is part of an area plan for the treatment of surface water that could 
cost about $2 billion to implement. 
City Councilman Carroll Robinson, who heads the council infrastructure 
committee, said he expects to hold two hearings about the contract. One would 
focus on how the Hawk board picked Montgomery Watson. A series of three 
recommendations from City Hall staff recommended Azurix. 
Hawk board members said Montgomery Watson's prices were lower by millions and 
that Azurix plans to sell Azurix North America, the body that would oversee 
this contract. 
The second City Council hearing will focus on financing, Robinson said. ""In 
my mind, how the city will pay for this construction is as important as who 
will do it,"" Robinson said. 
The Hawk board, appointed by Brown and approved by City Council, has been 
heavily lobbied by the contenders for the job. 
Because City Council does not have to follow the Hawk recommendation, new 
pressure has begun at City Hall. The third bidder, U.S. Filter Operating 
Services, part of a French company, has been heavily lobbying some council 
members to switch the contract to it. 
Some members of the Azurix team -- people at companies that would have gotten 
work had Azurix gotten the job -- have written letters complaining about the 
Hawk procedures as well. 
John M. Stokes, president and chief executive officer of Azurix, penned the 
first such distressed missive. In April, he wrote to Hawk board Chairman 
David Berg complaining of the ""deleterious economic effect"" on Azurix of the 
board's decision to negotiate with Montgomery Watson. He requested that Berg 
answer a series of questions in writing explaining why Azurix didn't get the 
job. Berg didn't do so. 
Although that letter had a threatening tone, Amanda Martin, president of 
Azurix North America, said no threat was intended and the letter simply 
indicated how upset the team was when it first learned Azurix wasn't chosen. 
Azurix was the rumored front-runner for months. 


		

		
		
		
		INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY: Enron may cut stake in Gulf gas project 
Financial Times; May 15, 2001
By ROBIN ALLEN

		There are growing fears that Enron, the US power company, may withdraw or 
sharply reduce its stake in the Gulf's Dollars 10bn Dolphin gas export 
scheme, one of the most ambitious of its kind in the region. 
		Enron officials have refused to comment on reports that the company is 
reconsidering its position as a minority shareholder in Dolphin Energy, in 
which France's TotalFinaElf (TFE) also has 24.5 per cent. 
		However, one industry specialist said yesterday Enron was talking of 
""selling"" at least part of its shareholding. 
		The threat raises critical issues for western companies seeking to profit 
from accessing state-owned oil and gas in the Gulf. 
		The project was launched two years ago by Abu Dhabi, the wealthiest of the 
United Arab Emirates, to promote energy security for the Gulf. But Abu 
Dhabiis seen as a prime example of a state where prestige and opaque domestic 
political considerations can be as important as profitability in such a 
large-scale project, especially in the early stages. 
		Dolphin's majority owner is UAE's Offsets Group (UOG), an offshoot of Abu 
Dhabi's defence procurement industry. In March, Dolphin, a relative newcomer 
on Abu Dhabi's energy scene, signed a Dollars 3.5bn agreement with Qatar to 
exploit and pipe up to 2bn cubic feet a day of gas from Qatar's prolific 
North Field to Abu Dhabi. 
		Qatari gas is the source of Abu Dhabi's long-term energy strategy, and Enron
's role was to develop, at a profit, the downstream section, primarily to 
construct and lay the 350km pipeline from Qatar to Abu Dhabi. 
		Enron is not a specialist in energy production or pipeline fabrication, but 
one of its main aims, according to one analyst, was to gain access to the gas 
accruing to it from the Qatar deal and then trade it on. Sheikh Zayed Bin 
Sultan al-Nahyan, Abu Dhabi's ruler, disapproves of commodity trading. 
		""If the Qatar-UAE gas deal was going to be profitable"" for western energy 
majors, asked one senior western diplomat, ""then why are the serious US 
energy majors not involved?"" For more reports see www.ft.com/globaleconomy

JAPAN: Enron says high power rates costing Japan.

05/15/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

TOKYO, May 15 (Reuters) - A senior executive of U.S. energy giant Enron Corp 
said on Tuesday that Japan could save an estimated four trillion yen ($32.45 
billion) in annual costs if electricity rates were cut to the average of 
members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). 
""If you were to pare Japanese industrial electric rates to the OECD 
average...savings to all...customers would be about four trillion yen per 
year,"" Enron Corp Vice President Steven Kean told a seminar in Tokyo.
Speaking at a seminar on electric power deregulation, Kean said that 
indigenous factors such as steep land prices and a lack of natural energy 
resources were often blamed for Japan's high electricity rates. 
But he said these factors were not sufficient to explain Japan's high 
electricity rates. 
A report commissioned by Enron Japan Corp showed that in 1998 Japan's 
electricity rates for industrial users were 16.81 yen per kilowatt hour (kWh) 
compared to a second highest rate of 12.44 yen in Italy. 
Japan's business sector has expressed concern at the nation's high 
electricity rates, saying that it blunts their competitive edge on the 
international market. 
Kean also drew parallels between Japan, in the midst of deregulation, and 
California which has been suffering from a power shortage since deregulating 
its market in 1998. 
These included the length of time that authorities in Japan took to issue 
permits to allow the construction of new power plants, he said. 
""The regulatory structure in Japan is very strict...just like in California,"" 
Kean said. 
North America's biggest buyer and seller of electricity, Enron gained its 
first foothold in Japan in 1999 when it established affiliate E Power Corp. 
In April of last year, it set up subsidiary Enron Japan Corp. 
Kean urged Japan to step up measures to open up its power market, a process 
he said held many benefits. 
Japan is in the process of deregulating its power market. Since March last 
year, large-lot consumers have been free to chose their suppliers. The 
measure liberalised an estimated 30 percent of the power market and ended 
Japan's 10 power utilities regional monopoly. 
However, industry watchers note that there have been very few new entrants 
and that further deregulation measures must be taken for rates to fall. The 
Japanese government is due to review the process in 2003.

Japan Must Speed Up Pwr Sector Dereg To Lower Rates-Indus

05/15/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

TOKYO -(Dow Jones)- Japan should accelerate the ongoing electric power sector 
deregulation to fully liberalize the retail market, in order to bring down 
the country's high power rates while ensuring stable power supply, experts 
said at an industry seminar Tuesday. 
The pressure is mounting for Japan's 10 power utilities, which have long 
enjoyed regional monopolies until a year ago, to become cost- effective and 
performance-conscious after the government partially liberalized the retail 
power market in March 2000.
However, the current scheme has so far failed to lure a large number of 
potential entrants because of the high transmission fees they must pay to 
conventional power companies. 
""What happened in overseas (power industries) suggest that the liberalization 
in Japan wouldn't only lower power rates but would also contribute to stable 
power supply significantly,"" said Tatsuo Hatta, professor of economics at the 
University of Tokyo. 
Compared with the U.S., Japanese electricity charges are typically twice as 
much for households and three times higher for industrial users. 
""There is a large discrepancy (in rates), and that is why we should hurriedly 
implement the liberalization,"" Hatta said. 
He said Japan's steep seasonal peak-load curve - one of the reasons the power 
companies cite as the cause of high power rates in Japan - can be altered 
once the prices are liberalized. ""If power rates are set higher during those 
peak hours following the liberalization, users would refrain from using 
electricity."" 
Steven Kean, executive vice president of the U.S. energy major, Enron Corp. 
(ENE), told the same seminar that Japan's power costs remain on the upward 
trend despite cost reductions in Europe and the U.S. 
He said Japan could achieve a cost-saving of Y4 trillion a year if its power 
prices fall to levels in Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development countries following the liberalization. 
Hatta and Kean were speaking at the seminar called ""Reassessing Power 
Deregulation,"" which was co-sponsored by the Houston-based Enron. 

Hatta of the University of Tokyo said ""it's very wise"" that Japan has begun 
the deregulation with the ""bilateral supply, or trade"" system under which 
suppliers and users clinch deals directly. 
Under the current reforms, the sector for high-volume, large-lot industrial 
and commercial users - which represents only 30% of the Y15 trillion market - 
is opened to free competition. The government is to review the partial 
deregulation by 2003 for further deregulation. 
Japan should then introduce spot electricity trading such as futures and 
derivatives to alleviate risks of complicated price volatility for power 
providers, Hatta said. 
Hatta and other experts attending the seminar said further deregulation 
should destroy the systems that have supported the country's high power rates 
- regional monopolies and the fair rate return method, under which all costs 
are levied on prices. 
""There is absolutely no need to set the same (power) prices"" nationwide, 
Hatta said. Power companies should make the opaque transmission fees 
transparent and set them accordingly with regional demand, he said. 
Yoshinori Omuro, vice president of Takashimaya Co.'s (J.TKA or 8233) 
management department, acknowledged the slow progress of the deregulation. 
Takashimaya, a major department store operator, has shifted to Diamond Power 
Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corp. (J.MIB or 8058) as its 
power supplier at two of its 18 stores, with ""strong back-up"" from the 
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. 
""Despite the deregulation, the situation isn't where we can negotiate with

SINGAPORE: ANALYSIS-No Asia fallout seen from Enron's India woes.

SINGAPORE, May 15 (Reuters) - A bitter payment battle between U.S. energy 
giant Enron Corp and authorities in India will serve as a reminder to foreign 
investors of the risks of putting money into emerging markets, analysts and 
bankers say. 
But it is unlikely to deter the flow of money into Asian electricity projects.
The pace of power privatisation and deregulation varies too greatly from 
country to country for the controversy in India to chill investment activity 
across Asia, they say. 
It does, however, underline the risks companies take despite some security 
offered by government payment guarantees. 
""Independant power producers (IPPs) will see Enron and Dabhol as an 
illustration of the dangers and possible risks of investing in an emerging 
market, but it would be going too far to say that other markets will be 
adversely affected because of it,"" said Philip Jackson, a banker with JP 
Morgan Chase in Hong Kong. 
Enron is on the verge of bailing out of an almost completed $2.9 billion 
power project because of a decade-long dispute with the troubled Maharashtra 
State Electricity Board (MSEB) over pricing and unpaid bills. 
MSEB has fallen about six months behind in paying for electricity supplied by 
Dabhol Power Co, the Indian unit of Houston-based Enron. 
The utility said last month that it had repaid about $28.6 million of the 
$48.2 million outstanding. 
The board of Dabhol has authorised the management to stop selling power to 
MSEB if the dispute is not resolved. Local media reports earlier in May said 
Enron was pulling executives out of India and relocating them elsewhere. 
Dabhol has invoked payment guarantees issued by the state and federal 
governments, but neither has stepped forward to foot the bill. 
GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES 
Banks often demand sponsor or host government guarantees to lessen risk 
before financing energy projects, which have long lead times and high capital 
expenditure. 
Governments are keen to provide guarantees to attract foreign investment. 
Guarantees may cover shortfalls in production, default of customer payment or 
even changes in market conditions. 
But such guarantees do not always provide the desired safety net and analysts 
said the legal systems in many emerging nations are simply not efficient 
enough to back these agreements. 
Enron's experience in India highlighted the risks of power investment in 
emerging countries and the unpredictability of government guarantees, they 
said. 
""Guarantees like that are painful for companies and for polititicians they're 
even more so,"" said John Vautrain, vice president at Purvin & Gertz in 
Singapore. 
""If the call is substantial, it's going to be bad."" 
Robert Booth, director of the Bardak Group in West Perth, Australia, was more 
pessimistic and reckoned some companies might take a lead from Enron and shy 
away from emerging Asian nations. 
""Investors will pull back from these countries until they see that there is a 
properly functioning legal system that gives them assurance if they have to 
call in a government guarantee,"" Booth said.

MANAMA, Bahrain -(Dow Jones)- Saudi Arabia's supreme petroleum council is 
expected to hold a meeting Tuesday evening, but it's unlikely to declare its 
choice of international oil companies to participate in downstream gas 
projects, Arabic al-Hayat newspaper reported. 
The newspaper quoted sources at the government's technical committee 
overseeing the proposed projects as saying that the committee hasn't 
completed its final report concerning the oil companies' offers.
""Studies and recommendations haven't been completed yet and they need some 
time in order to present the project at its final structure, attached with 
recommendations from the technical committee,"" the sources said, according to 
the newspaper. 
However, the oil council ""might endorse some balances concerning the offers,"" 
the newspaper said but didn't elaborate further. 
Sources in Saudi Arabia have said the oil companies were expected to be 
notified soon on whether they have been selected to participate in the gas 
projects. 
Saudi Arabia invited international oil companies in October 1998 to 
participate in proposals for downstream gas projects and upstream gas 
enhancement. 
After a series of meetings between the negotiating committee and the oil 
companies in the past year, several companies were shortlisted for each 
project. 
The companies shortlisted for Core Venture 1, the $15 billion South Ghawar 
Area Development were Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD), BP PLC (BP), Exxon Mobil 
Corp. (XOM), Chevron Corp. (CHV), Total Fina Elf S.A. (TOT) and ENI SpA (E). 
For Core Venture 2, the Red Sea Development, Enron Corp. (ENE) and Occidental 
Petroleum Corp. (OXY) are bidding jointly and Exxon Mobil, Total Fina Elf, 
Marathon Oil Canada Inc. (T.M), Shell and Conoco Inc. (COCA) were 
shortlisted. 
And for Core Venture 3, the Shaybah area, Total Fina Elf, Conoco, Phillips 
Petroleum (P), Enron and Occidental, Exxon Mobil, Shell and Marathon Oil were 
shortlisted.

MSEB refutes allegations by Enron, DPC

MUMBAI 
THE MAHARASHTRA State Electricity Board on Monday in a letter to Enron 
refuted all allegations made against it by the company while invoking the 
political force majeure.
Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company on April 9 had invoked the political 
force majeure clause. DPC had indicated it was not in a position to fulfil 
its contractual obligations to MSEB because of political circumstances beyond 
its control. 
MSEB in a reply on Monday denied Enron's allegation of 'political 
circumstances' and said there was no reason why it should have felt insecure. 
""Such a step was necessary under the Power Purchase Agreement and related 
security documents to notify the board of 'certain events and to enforce our 
rights',"" DPC had said. However, according to MSEB, such a step by DPC was 
uncalled for. 
For DPC, invoking the force majeure clause was necessary as 'certain events 
occurred that are beyond the reasonable control of the affected party (DPC)'. 
MSEB has expressed surprise in a letter on Monday. 
The energy major had dispatched the notice to MSEB, as an affected party, 
which had been subjected to ""concerted, deliberate and politically motivated 
actions of state government, the Government of India and the Board, which 
will have a material and adverse effect on DPC's ability to perform 
obligations under PPA"". 
""Given the cumulative effect of these political actions, DPC determined that 
the political force majeure declaration is an appropriate mechanism for 
providing that notice, and that is an appropriate and necessary step in 
protecting DPC and its stakeholders' rights,"" the statement added. 
However, for MSEB this was 'yet another move' from Enron to avoid paying Rs 
402 crore penalty the MSEB has slapped on it for failing to supply 
electricity as per the agreement. 
MSEB, in today's letter, reiterated its suggestion to adjust December 2000 
and Januray 2001 bills, against the Rs 800 crore penalty it has slapped on 
Enron for not supplying electricity as per demand. 
MSEB has refused to pay DPC's December 2000 and January 2001 bills worth Rs 
213 crore.

RIYADH : Saudi Arabia's Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC) is holding meetings 
on bids by 12 foreign oil majors for three giant gas projects and should take 
a decision shortly, a top oil official said on Monday. ""The SPC has been 
discussing recommendations by the negotiating committee about the bids, and 
the meetings will continues executive president of the committee Abdulrahman 
al-Suhaibani told AFP. 
""It is not clear yet when the discussions will be completed and wham a final 
decision will be issued,"" added Suhaibani, who expected it to be soon. The 
meetings began two weeks ago.
A senior foreign oil executive in the kingdom expected an answer to his 
firm's bid by the end of this week or the start of next week. 
""The SPC is holding a crucial meeting today (Monday) and tomorrow. bin were 
told we would get an answer to our proposals either this weekend or early 
next week,"" the executive told AFP. 
The negotiating committee made detailed recommendations after meeting with 
the representative of 12 international oil companies (IOCs) which are bidding 
for the three multi-billion projects, the executive said. 
The committee, comprising ministers who are also SPC members, is headed by 
Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal. 
The gas projects, which would be the first foreign investment 
in the kingdom's energy sector since nationalisation in 1961, are located in 
the South Ghawar field near Al-Hufuf in the Eastern Province, Shaybah in the 
Empty Quarter desert, and the northern Red Sea area. 
They cover 440,000 square kilometres (176,000 square miles), making it the 
world's largest area for hydrocarbon investment. 
US majors Enron and Occidental in a joint bid, as well as Chevron, 
Conocokilometres, ExxonMobil, Marathon, Phillips and Texaco have been 
shortlisted for the Saudi projects. Rounding out the list are European firms 
BP Amoco, Eni, Royal Dutch Shell and TotalFinaElf. 
ExxonMobil, Shell and TotalFinaElf are in the bidding for all three ventures. 
The investment involves gas exploration and production, setting up 
petrochemical industries and power and water desalination plants. 
The projects, called the natural gas initiative, are to be carried out 
simultaneously by consortia of two to three firms in cooperation with Aramco, 
the national oil company, on long-term basis for up to 30 years, the 
executive said. 
Aramco has been working to double the Saudi gas network's capacity from the 
current 3.5 billion cubic feet (105 million cubic metres) per day to seven 
billion cubic feet (210 million metres) daily in 2004. 
Saudi Arabia, which sits on top of the world's biggest oil reserves, has 
proven natural gas reserves of 220 trillion cubic feet (6.6 trillion cubic 
metres).-AFP

Hawk vote for California firm unanimous 
Montgomery Watson pegged for water plant 
By MARY FLOOD 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
The Houston Area Water Corp. voted unanimously Monday to grant a $92 million 
contract to a California-based firm to design, build and operate a Lake 
Houston water plant. 
City Council soon will receive the contract for its approval. The 
administration of Mayor Lee Brown was believed to have favored Montgomery 
Watson's chief competitor, Azurix Corp., an arm of local energy giant Enron 
Corp. 
The water corporation, known as ""the Hawk,"" voted 5-0 to grant the contract. 
If approved by City Council, the contract would give the company 2 1/2 years 
to get the plant up and treating raw lake water. 
It was initially expected that the plant, which will be designed to handle 40 
million gallons of water daily, could cost as much as $150 million to build. 
The Hawk board asked the vying companies to modify their bids several times, 
and that caused the competitors to lower their prices. 
The contract calls for the Hawk to pay a monthly operating fee of $157,000 
when the plant is working. And Montgomery Watson could be required to 
construct, at the Hawk's option, an additional 40 million-gallon-a-day plant 
expansion for $32 million. 
But the details of how the plant will be financed have not been determined. 
The Hawk board discussed borrowing money using the city's credit rating on a 
short-term basis until it could develop long-term financing by selling bonds 
itself. 
The initial customer for the water is the city of Houston, which would repay 
the Hawk the cost of producing the treated water. The hope is that the plant 
eventually will provide water to other entities in the area as well. This 
plant is part of an area plan for the treatment of surface water that could 
cost about $2 billion to implement. 
City Councilman Carroll Robinson, who heads the council infrastructure 
committee, said he expects to hold two hearings about the contract. One would 
focus on how the Hawk board picked Montgomery Watson. A series of three 
recommendations from City Hall staff recommended Azurix. 
Hawk board members said Montgomery Watson's prices were lower by millions and 
that Azurix plans to sell Azurix North America, the body that would oversee 
this contract. 
The second City Council hearing will focus on financing, Robinson said. ""In 
my mind, how the city will pay for this construction is as important as who 
will do it,"" Robinson said. 
The Hawk board, appointed by Brown and approved by City Council, has been 
heavily lobbied by the contenders for the job. 
Because City Council does not have to follow the Hawk recommendation, new 
pressure has begun at City Hall. The third bidder, U.S. Filter Operating 
Services, part of a French company, has been heavily lobbying some council 
members to switch the contract to it. 
Some members of the Azurix team -- people at companies that would have gotten 
work had Azurix gotten the job -- have written letters complaining about the 
Hawk procedures as well. 
John M. Stokes, president and chief executive officer of Azurix, penned the 
first such distressed missive. In April, he wrote to Hawk board Chairman 
David Berg complaining of the ""deleterious economic effect"" on Azurix of the 
board's decision to negotiate with Montgomery Watson. He requested that Berg 
answer a series of questions in writing explaining why Azurix didn't get the 
job. Berg didn't do so. 
Although that letter had a threatening tone, Amanda Martin, president of 
Azurix North America, said no threat was intended and the letter simply 
indicated how upset the team was when it first learned Azurix wasn't chosen. 
Azurix was the rumored front-runner for months. 


		

		
		
		
		INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY: Enron may cut stake in Gulf gas project 
Financial Times; May 15, 2001
By ROBIN ALLEN

		There are growing fears that Enron, the US power company, may withdraw or 
sharply reduce its stake in the Gulf's Dollars 10bn Dolphin gas export 
scheme, one of the most ambitious of its kind in the region. 
		Enron officials have refused to comment on reports that the company is 
reconsidering its position as a minority shareholder in Dolphin Energy, in 
which France's TotalFinaElf (TFE) also has 24.5 per cent. 
		However, one industry specialist said yesterday Enron was talking of 
""selling"" at least part of its shareholding. 
		The threat raises critical issues for western companies seeking to profit 
from accessing state-owned oil and gas in the Gulf. 
		The project was launched two years ago by Abu Dhabi, the wealthiest of the 
United Arab Emirates, to promote energy security for the Gulf. But Abu 
Dhabiis seen as a prime example of a state where prestige and opaque domestic 
political considerations can be as important as profitability in such a 
large-scale project, especially in the early stages. 
		Dolphin's majority owner is UAE's Offsets Group (UOG), an offshoot of Abu 
Dhabi's defence procurement industry. In March, Dolphin, a relative newcomer 
on Abu Dhabi's energy scene, signed a Dollars 3.5bn agreement with Qatar to 
exploit and pipe up to 2bn cubic feet a day of gas from Qatar's prolific 
North Field to Abu Dhabi. 
		Qatari gas is the source of Abu Dhabi's long-term energy strategy, and Enron
's role was to develop, at a profit, the downstream section, primarily to 
construct and lay the 350km pipeline from Qatar to Abu Dhabi. 
		Enron is not a specialist in energy production or pipeline fabrication, but 
one of its main aims, according to one analyst, was to gain access to the gas 
accruing to it from the Qatar deal and then trade it on. Sheikh Zayed Bin 
Sultan al-Nahyan, Abu Dhabi's ruler, disapproves of commodity trading. 
		""If the Qatar-UAE gas deal was going to be profitable"" for western energy 
majors, asked one senior western diplomat, ""then why are the serious US 
energy majors not involved?"" For more reports see www.ft.com/globaleconomy

JAPAN: Enron says high power rates costing Japan.

05/15/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

TOKYO, May 15 (Reuters) - A senior executive of U.S. energy giant Enron Corp 
said on Tuesday that Japan could save an estimated four trillion yen ($32.45 
billion) in annual costs if electricity rates were cut to the average of 
members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). 
""If you were to pare Japanese industrial electric rates to the OECD 
average...savings to all...customers would be about four trillion yen per 
year,"" Enron Corp Vice President Steven Kean told a seminar in Tokyo.
Speaking at a seminar on electric power deregulation, Kean said that 
indigenous factors such as steep land prices and a lack of natural energy 
resources were often blamed for Japan's high electricity rates. 
But he said these factors were not sufficient to explain Japan's high 
electricity rates. 
A report commissioned by Enron Japan Corp showed that in 1998 Japan's 
electricity rates for industrial users were 16.81 yen per kilowatt hour (kWh) 
compared to a second highest rate of 12.44 yen in Italy. 
Japan's business sector has expressed concern at the nation's high 
electricity rates, saying that it blunts their competitive edge on the 
international market. 
Kean also drew parallels between Japan, in the midst of deregulation, and 
California which has been suffering from a power shortage since deregulating 
its market in 1998. 
These included the length of time that authorities in Japan took to issue 
permits to allow the construction of new power plants, he said. 
""The regulatory structure in Japan is very strict...just like in California,"" 
Kean said. 
North America's biggest buyer and seller of electricity, Enron gained its 
first foothold in Japan in 1999 when it established affiliate E Power Corp. 
In April of last year, it set up subsidiary Enron Japan Corp. 
Kean urged Japan to step up measures to open up its power market, a process 
he said held many benefits. 
Japan is in the process of deregulating its power market. Since March last 
year, large-lot consumers have been free to chose their suppliers. The 
measure liberalised an estimated 30 percent of the power market and ended 
Japan's 10 power utilities regional monopoly. 
However, industry watchers note that there have been very few new entrants 
and that further deregulation measures must be taken for rates to fall. The 
Japanese government is due to review the process in 2003.

Japan Must Speed Up Pwr Sector Dereg To Lower Rates-Indus

05/15/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

TOKYO -(Dow Jones)- Japan should accelerate the ongoing electric power sector 
deregulation to fully liberalize the retail market, in order to bring down 
the country's high power rates while ensuring stable power supply, experts 
said at an industry seminar Tuesday. 
The pressure is mounting for Japan's 10 power utilities, which have long 
enjoyed regional monopolies until a year ago, to become cost- effective and 
performance-conscious after the government partially liberalized the retail 
power market in March 2000.
However, the current scheme has so far failed to lure a large number of 
potential entrants because of the high transmission fees they must pay to 
conventional power companies. 
""What happened in overseas (power industries) suggest that the liberalization 
in Japan wouldn't only lower power rates but would also contribute to stable 
power supply significantly,"" said Tatsuo Hatta, professor of economics at the 
University of Tokyo. 
Compared with the U.S., Japanese electricity charges are typically twice as 
much for households and three times higher for industrial users. 
""There is a large discrepancy (in rates), and that is why we should hurriedly 
implement the liberalization,"" Hatta said. 
He said Japan's steep seasonal peak-load curve - one of the reasons the power 
companies cite as the cause of high power rates in Japan - can be altered 
once the prices are liberalized. ""If power rates are set higher during those 
peak hours following the liberalization, users would refrain from using 
electricity."" 
Steven Kean, executive vice president of the U.S. energy major, Enron Corp. 
(ENE), told the same seminar that Japan's power costs remain on the upward 
trend despite cost reductions in Europe and the U.S. 
He said Japan could achieve a cost-saving of Y4 trillion a year if its power 
prices fall to levels in Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development countries following the liberalization. 
Hatta and Kean were speaking at the seminar called ""Reassessing Power 
Deregulation,"" which was co-sponsored by the Houston-based Enron. 

Hatta of the University of Tokyo said ""it's very wise"" that Japan has begun 
the deregulation with the ""bilateral supply, or trade"" system under which 
suppliers and users clinch deals directly. 
Under the current reforms, the sector for high-volume, large-lot industrial 
and commercial users - which represents only 30% of the Y15 trillion market - 
is opened to free competition. The government is to review the partial 
deregulation by 2003 for further deregulation. 
Japan should then introduce spot electricity trading such as futures and 
derivatives to alleviate risks of complicated price volatility for power 
providers, Hatta said. 
Hatta and other experts attending the seminar said further deregulation 
should destroy the systems that have supported the country's high power rates 
- regional monopolies and the fair rate return method, under which all costs 
are levied on prices. 
""There is absolutely no need to set the same (power) prices"" nationwide, 
Hatta said. Power companies should make the opaque transmission fees 
transparent and set them accordingly with regional demand, he said. 
Yoshinori Omuro, vice president of Takashimaya Co.'s (J.TKA or 8233) 
management department, acknowledged the slow progress of the deregulation. 
Takashimaya, a major department store operator, has shifted to Diamond Power 
Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corp. (J.MIB or 8058) as its 
power supplier at two of its 18 stores, with ""strong back-up"" from the 
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. 
""Despite the deregulation, the situation isn't where we can negotiate with 
power utilities to reduce (electricity costs). We have no choice but select 
independent power providers,"" Omuro said.

MSEB in a reply on Monday denied Enron's allegation of 'political 
circumstances' and said there was no reason why it should have felt insecure. 
""Such a step was necessary under the Power Purchase Agreement and related 
security documents to notify the board of 'certain events and to enforce our 
rights',"" DPC had said. However, according to MSEB, such a step by DPC was 
uncalled for. 
For DPC, invoking the force majeure clause was necessary as 'certain events 
occurred that are beyond the reasonable control of the affected party (DPC)'. 
MSEB has expressed surprise in a letter on Monday. 
The energy major had dispatched the notice to MSEB, as an affected party, 
which had been subjected to ""concerted, deliberate and politically motivated 
actions of state government, the Government of India and the Board, which 
will have a material and adverse effect on DPC's ability to perform 
obligations under PPA"". 
""Given the cumulative effect of these political actions, DPC determined that 
the political force majeure declaration is an appropriate mechanism for 
providing that notice, and that is an appropriate and necessary step in 
protecting DPC and its stakeholders' rights,"" the statement added. 
However, for MSEB this was 'yet another move' from Enron to avoid paying Rs 
402 crore penalty the MSEB has slapped on it for failing to supply 
electricity as per the agreement. 
MSEB, in today's letter, reiterated its suggestion to adjust December 2000 
and Januray 2001 bills, against the Rs 800 crore penalty it has slapped on 
Enron for not supplying electricity as per demand. 
MSEB has refused to pay DPC's December 2000 and January 2001 bills worth Rs 
213 crore.

RIYADH : Saudi Arabia's Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC) is holding meetings 
on bids by 12 foreign oil majors for three giant gas projects and should take 
a decision shortly, a top oil official said on Monday. ""The SPC has been 
discussing recommendations by the negotiating committee about the bids, and 
the meetings will continues executive president of the committee Abdulrahman 
al-Suhaibani told AFP. 
""It is not clear yet when the discussions will be completed and wham a final 
decision will be issued,"" added Suhaibani, who expected it to be soon. The 
meetings began two weeks ago.
A senior foreign oil executive in the kingdom expected an answer to his 
firm's bid by the end of this week or the start of next week. 
""The SPC is holding a crucial meeting today (Monday) and tomorrow. bin were 
told we would get an answer to our proposals either this weekend or early 
next week,"" the executive told AFP. 
The negotiating committee made detailed recommendations after meeting with 
the representative of 12 international oil companies (IOCs) which are bidding 
for the three multi-billion projects, the executive said. 
The committee, comprising ministers who are also SPC members, is headed by 
Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal. 
The gas projects, which would be the first foreign investment 
in the kingdom's energy sector since nationalisation in 1961, are located in 
the South Ghawar field near Al-Hufuf in the Eastern Province, Shaybah in the 
Empty Quarter desert, and the northern Red Sea area. 
They cover 440,000 square kilometres (176,000 square miles), making it the 
world's largest area for hydrocarbon investment. 
US majors Enron and Occidental in a joint bid, as well as Chevron, 
Conocokilometres, ExxonMobil, Marathon, Phillips and Texaco have been 
shortlisted for the Saudi projects. Rounding out the list are European firms 
BP Amoco, Eni, Royal Dutch Shell and TotalFinaElf. 
ExxonMobil, Shell and TotalFinaElf are in the bidding for all three ventures. 
The investment involves gas exploration and production, setting up 
petrochemical industries and power and water desalination plants. 
The projects, called the natural gas initiative, are to be carried out 
simultaneously by consortia of two to three firms in cooperation with Aramco, 
the national oil company, on long-term basis for up to 30 years, the 
executive said. 
Aramco has been working to double the Saudi gas network's capacity from the 
current 3.5 billion cubic feet (105 million cubic metres) per day to seven 
billion cubic feet (210 million metres) daily in 2004. 
Saudi Arabia, which sits on top of the world's biggest oil reserves, has 
proven natural gas reserves of 220 trillion cubic feet (6.6 trillion cubic 
metres).-AFP

The 25-odd lenders to the Dabhol power project will vote today on whether the 
Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) should be allowed to to serve a 
preliminary PPA termination notice to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board 
(MSEB). The voting will take place through conference calls criss-crossing 
the globe at 6.30 pm, Indian Standard Time. Even though the three Indian 
lenders_ the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), the State Bank of 
India (SBI) and ICICI_ have decided to vote against the proposition, they 
will not be able to block the move.
Technically, the proposal can be passed if four per cent of lenders are in 
favour of the termination notice. In effect, it will be passed if one of the 
25 lenders casts its vote in favour of it. So, it's almost a foregone 
conclusion that DPC will be asked to issue its termination notice. 
Multilateral agency J-Exim, which has provided guarantees, will not 
participate in the exercise. Barring J-Exim, other financial intermediaries 
including global arrangers ABN Amro, Citi, ANZIB, CSFB and other banks and 
OPIC will cast their votes tomorrow. ""In the first round, Indian lenders put 
their foot down and refused to give clearance to the termination notice. 
Thistime around they will not be able to block the move any more. The Indian 
lenders alone cannot save the controversial $3 billion as some of the foreign 
lenders are in favour of issuing the termination notice,"" said a source. The 
Indian lenders are in favour of completing the project without any time and 
cost over-run. They have disbursed about 80 per cent of their Rs 1,500 crore 
worth of loan commitments to phase II of the project, 93 per cent of which is 
complete. The trial run is expected to commence in June. The board of the 
Dabhol Power Company has already authorised Enron India managing director, K 
Wade Cline, to serve a termination notice as and when he deems fit. At a 
meeting of the lenders last month in London, the foreign lenders were keen 
that the termination notice be served in the face of defaults by the 
Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and the Union government's refusal 
to honour the counter-guarantee of Rs 102 crore for the December bill. The 
domestic lenders are not covered by the counter-guarantee if the contract is 
terminated. The foreign lenders are covered by the counter-guarantee.

USA: Sempra unit to boost natgas delivery to California.

05/15/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SAN FRANCISCO, May 15 (Reuters) - Southern California Gas Co. (SCG) said in a 
statement on Tuesday it will add around 200 million cubic feet a day, or 
about six percent, to its pipeline system by the end of the year in order to 
meet the surge in demand for gas-fired power generation. 
Today's announcement comes two months after SCG, a unit of Sempra Energy , 
proposed to increase capacity on its system by 175 mmcfd, or five percent.
Both projects will add around 11 percent of new gas capacity to its 
transmission system this year, the company said in a statement. 
In its latest proposal, called the Kramer Junction Interconnect, SCG said it 
would build a 32-mile pipeline link to the Kern-Mojave pipeline system that 
will allow it to deliver around 200 mmcfd into its system. 
The new capacity would be enough to drive three 500-megawatt power plants or 
enough gas to serve 1.4 million residential customers a day, the statement 
said. 
SCG, the nation's largest gas utility with more 18 million consumers in 
central and Southern California, said utilization of its intrastate 
transmission system in the past nine months had jumped from 75 percent to 
over 95 percent, due largely to the rise in gas-fired power generation. 
The company's announcement is the latest in several proposals to expand gas 
pipeline capacity to California, where demand for gas is expected to jump 
because of the number of gas-fired power plants being built or scheduled for 
construction. 
Gas is already used to generate about a third of California's electricity. 
And since April 1999, the state has approved 13 major gas-fired power plant 
projects with a combined generation capacity of more than 8,900 megawatts. 
Nine gas-fired power plants, with a total generation capacity of more than 
6,000 megawatts, are under construction. 
Over the past two months plans to build or expand gas lines serving 
California have been announced by Enron unit Transwestern, Williams Cos' Kern 
River Transmission, El Paso Corp. units El Paso Natural Gas Co. and Mohave 
Pipeline Co., Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. unit National Energy Group, 
Questar Corp. , Calpine Corp. , and Kinder Morgan .

Enron Urges Reforms In Japan Electricity Market-Nikkei

05/15/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

TOKYO (Nikkei)--Asserting that cuts in electricity prices will help Japanese 
companies save as much as Y4 trillion, major U.S. energy firm Enron Corp. 
(ENE) on Tuesday urged Japanese power firms to revamp the electricity market 
by separating operations such as power generation, transmission and 
distribution, The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported. 
Enron's 10-point proposal also calls for the construction of more power 
plants and full-scale deregulation of retail electricity, including sales to 
households. If such measures are carried out and electricity prices fall to 
match the levels of other industrialized nations, Japan's industrial sector 
could trim its costs by Y4 trillion, Enron said.
At a seminar on power industry deregulation hosted by Enron, the company 
asserted that Japan's deregulation in such areas as wholesale electricity 
auctions in 1996 and bulk retail sales last year has not brought significant 
benefits to end-users. 
New suppliers entering the market only account for a combined 0.4% of the 
entire electricity sector, Enron said, criticizing the fact that power plant 
facilities are mainly concentrated among electric power companies. 
Regarding prices, an official representing operators of power generation 
facilities asserted that ""industrial-use electricity prices in Japan are 
stuck at a high level at around Y13 per kilowatt, compared with Y5 in the 
U.S., Y3 in Canada, Y9 in Germany and Y4-Y8 in Southeast Asia."" 
In fact, department store operator Takashimaya Co. (8233 or J.TKA), which 
last November switched to new market entrants for part of its electricity 
supply, was able to cut costs by Y450 million in the first year, said a 
company official. 
Enron hopes to generate competition by urging Japanese electric utilities to 
spin off different operations, analysts say. If the number of power 
generation facility operators increases, this will help bolster Japan's 
electricity trading market, an area in which Enron has a strong business 
interest. 
Splitting electricity operations into generation, transmission and 
distribution is expected to open the electric utility network to new 
entrants. This will boost transparency in the fees that electric power 
companies charge for transmitting power on behalf of the operators of power 
generation facilities, Enron says. 
Citing the power shortage in California, however, Japan's electricity sector 
has strongly opposed such spin-offs, stating that generation and distribution 
must be part of a single continuum to ensure a stable supply.

(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

CALGARY, May 15 /PRNewswire/ - NGX Canada Inc. (NGX), a wholly owned 
subsidiary of OM AB (OM), today announced that an arrangement has been made 
with Enron Canada Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. (Enron), 
whereby trading data from certain contracts listed on Enron's online trading 
system, EnronOnline will be included in the computation of three Alberta Gas 
Price Indices. 
NGX acquired the AECO ""C"" & NIT Daily Spot, One-Month Spot, and Bid-Week Spot 
gas price indices (Alberta Gas Price Indices) from Canadian Enerdata Ltd. 
last September. Subsequent to the acquisition of the Alberta Gas Price 
Indices, NGX has provided real-time information to its customers on the 
establishment of the weighted average price indices based on transactions 
conducted through NGX's trading system. Canadian Enerdata Limited continues 
to publish the Alberta Gas Price Indices in the Canadian Gas Price Reporter.
Peter Krenkel, President of NGX, stated, ""We believe that inclusion of data 
from EnronOnline will serve to make our price indices among the best in North 
America. The industry has been very supportive of the visibility and 
integrity we are able to bring to the Alberta Gas Price Indices, which 
removes the guesswork around gas price index methodology. However, after 
reviewing the matter with Enron and other industry participants, we 
recognized that Enron had legitimate concerns and the industry felt that 
""more is better"". The inclusion of data from the highly liquid EnronOnline 
system should improve the quality of our price indices even further."" 
Rob Milnthorp, President and CEO of Enron Canada commented, ""We are very 
pleased to have EnronOnline transactions included in the Alberta Gas Price 
Indices. This will provide industry participants with a more comprehensive 
source of data and a better opportunity to manage risk around these price 
indices as they are now assured that all their transactions on EnronOnline 
will be included in the computation of the Alberta Price Indices."" 
The inclusion of EnronOnline data satisfies the principal claims made by 
Enron in their legal action against NGX, Canadian Enerdata Ltd., OM and 
Richard Zarzeczny and Enron has agreed to discontinue the legal action 
against those parties with the conclusion of this arrangement. 
NGX and Enron are planning to implement the necessary system changes by 
August 1, 2001 but in any event will provide at least thirty days notice to 
the industry. Once in operation, data from transactions in the relevant 
contracts listed on EnronOnline will be fed to NGX in real-time. The 
methodology for computing the Alberta Gas Price Indices will continue to be 
on a weighted-average basis. 
NGX will engage independent auditors to insure full compliance with the Index 
Methodology Guide. This guide is available on NGX's website at www.ngx.com.

UAE To Seek New Partners If Enron Exits Dolphin Gas Proj

05/15/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- If U.S.-based Enron Corp. (ENE) pulls out of the $3.5 
billion Dolphin gas project, in which the company holds a 24.5% stake, the 
U.A.E. Offsets Group, or UOG, will consider other companies to replace it, a 
United Arab Emirates industry source close to the project said Tuesday. 
Industry sources Monday said Enron is considering withdrawing from the 
project because it doesn't believe it will be profitable.
Dolphin, an agreement signed two years ago by UOG and Qatar Petroleum, plans 
to bring 2 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from Qatar's offshore 
North Field to Abu Dhabi and onward to Dubai. 
Enron and TotalFinaElf (TOT) each hold a 24.5% stake in the project, while 
UOG owns the remaining 51%. 
Enron is set to focus on the midstream part of the project - gas 
transportation - which requires building a 350-kilometer pipeline from a 
processing plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar, to the Taweelah terminal in Abu Dhabi 
and the Jebel Ali terminal in Dubai. 
The U.A.E. source said originally, it was thought that the U.A.E. government 
would fund the pipeline, which is estimated to cost around $1 billion. 
However, more recently, the source said the U.A.E. suggested that Enron put 
up the money itself. 
Other industry sources said Enron and TotalFinaElf also had to pay 
significant fees to join the project. TotalFinaElf will
operate the upstream part of the project, which includes developing
natural gas reserves in two blocks of the North Field. First wells are 
scheduled to be drilled in the second half of 2001 and come onstream in 
2005. 

Last week, the Middle East Economic Survey reported that the foreign partners 
haven't yet agreed on the precise details of their working relationship or on 
the price of the pipeline. 
Qatar Petroleum and Dolphin Energy Ltd., a subsidiary of UOG, signed an 
initial agreement in March for the upstream section of the project. A full 
agreement is expected to be concluded in September, the source said.

Enron Should Sell Utility to Oregon, Lawmaker Argues (Update2)

Enron Should Sell Utility to Oregon, Lawmaker Argues (Update2)

     (Updates with closing share prices.)

     Washington, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. should sell
Portland General Electric Co. to Oregon so state consumers can be
insulated from soaring electricity prices, a congressman said.
     ``Purchasing PGE would give Oregon ratepayers more control by
keeping its assets in Oregon, accountable solely to Oregonians,''
U.S. Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat from Springfield,
Oregon, said in a letter to Governor John Kitzhaber.
     The governor is considering DeFazio's proposal, said
Kitzhaber spokesman Kevin Smith.
     Last month, Houston-based Enron, the biggest energy trader,
agreed to cancel the $3.1 billion sale of Portland General, a
utility with more than 700,000 Oregon customers, to Sierra Pacific
Resources of Reno, Nevada.
     Enron and Sierra Pacific blamed laws spawned by high power
prices and electricity shortages in the West for the sale's
collapse.
     ``We are pleased to keep Portland General in our asset
portfolio because it's a solid earnings performer,'' Enron
spokeswoman Karen Denne said. ``If approached by a buyer who
recognizes its value, we'd consider selling it.'' She declined to
comment on a potential bid by Oregon.
     The state should act swiftly, DeFazio said, citing press
reports that the U.K.'s Scottish Power Plc, owner of PacifiCorp,
the largest utility in the U.S Northwest, may bid for Portland
General.
     Scottish Power, based in Glasgow, Scotland, would have more
than 70 percent of Oregon electricity customers if it added
Portland General, raising ``serious regulatory concerns about
market power,'' he said.

                            Bond Issue

     Oregon could issue bonds to purchase Portland General, using
the utility's profits to pay the debt, DeFazio said. The state
might run it as a public utility or a cooperative, he said.
     Enron and Sierra Pacific called off the Portland General sale
because of laws passed by Nevada and California legislators that
slow the deregulation of their wholesale power markets.
     California and Nevada have blocked sales of power plants by
utilities. Sierra Pacific had to sell a stake in a Nevada power
plant that sells power to California to win regulatory approval of
the Portland General purchase.
     Average power prices on the California-Oregon border this
year have soared ninefold to $296.34 a megawatt hour over the year-
earlier period. A megawatt hour can light 750 average California
homes for an hour.
     Shares of Enron fell $1.76 to $$56.99. They've fallen 31
percent this year.
     Sierra Pacific rose 9 cents to $16.09. Scottish Power rose 9
pence to 492 ($7) in London.

Enron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1)

     (Adds closing share price.)

     Houston, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's
biggest energy trader, agreed to provide natural-gas pricing
information to NGX Canada Inc. and drop a C$100 million
($64.7 million) suit against the Canadian gas exchange.
     Enron sued NGX in November after the Internet exchange, a
unit of the company that owns the Stockholm Stock Exchange,
changed providers of its gas-pricing data and didn't include
trades on EnronOnline, Enron's Internet exchange, when calculating
gas-price indexes.
     Calgary-based NGX agreed to include EnronOnline trades in
calculating its Alberta Gas Price Indices by August, Enron
spokesman Eric Thode said.
     NGX, owned by Stockholm's OM Gruppen AB, is used by about 90
percent of Canadian gas traders, and many traders use EnronOnline
to sell gas from western Canada, the biggest supplier of the
cleaner-burning fuel to the U.S.

USA: Sempra unit to boost natgas delivery to California.

05/15/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SAN FRANCISCO, May 15 (Reuters) - Southern California Gas Co. (SCG) said in a 
statement on Tuesday it will add around 200 million cubic feet a day, or 
about six percent, to its pipeline system by the end of the year in order to 
meet the surge in demand for gas-fired power generation. 
Today's announcement comes two months after SCG, a unit of Sempra Energy , 
proposed to increase capacity on its system by 175 mmcfd, or five percent.
Both projects will add around 11 percent of new gas capacity to its 
transmission system this year, the company said in a statement. 
In its latest proposal, called the Kramer Junction Interconnect, SCG said it 
would build a 32-mile pipeline link to the Kern-Mojave pipeline system that 
will allow it to deliver around 200 mmcfd into its system. 
The new capacity would be enough to drive three 500-megawatt power plants or 
enough gas to serve 1.4 million residential customers a day, the statement 
said. 
SCG, the nation's largest gas utility with more 18 million consumers in 
central and Southern California, said utilization of its intrastate 
transmission system in the past nine months had jumped from 75 percent to 
over 95 percent, due largely to the rise in gas-fired power generation. 
The company's announcement is the latest in several proposals to expand gas 
pipeline capacity to California, where demand for gas is expected to jump 
because of the number of gas-fired power plants being built or scheduled for 
construction. 
Gas is already used to generate about a third of California's electricity. 
And since April 1999, the state has approved 13 major gas-fired power plant 
projects with a combined generation capacity of more than 8,900 megawatts. 
Nine gas-fired power plants, with a total generation capacity of more than 
6,000 megawatts, are under construction. 
Over the past two months plans to build or expand gas lines serving 
California have been announced by Enron unit Transwestern, Williams Cos' Kern 
River Transmission, El Paso Corp. units El Paso Natural Gas Co. and Mohave 
Pipeline Co., Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. unit National Energy Group, 
Questar Corp. , Calpine Corp. , and Kinder Morgan .

Enron Urges Reforms In Japan Electricity Market-Nikkei

05/15/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

TOKYO (Nikkei)--Asserting that cuts in electricity prices will help Japanese 
companies save as much as Y4 trillion, major U.S. energy firm Enron Corp. 
(ENE) on Tuesday urged Japanese power firms to revamp the electricity market 
by separating operations such as power generation, transmission and 
distribution, The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported. 
Enron's 10-point proposal also calls for the construction of more power 
plants and full-scale deregulation of retail electricity, including sales to 
households. If such measures are carried out and electricity prices fall to 
match the levels of other industrialized nations, Japan's industrial sector 
could trim its costs by Y4 trillion, Enron said.
At a seminar on power industry deregulation hosted by Enron, the company 
asserted that Japan's deregulation in such areas as wholesale electricity 
auctions in 1996 and bulk retail sales last year has not brought significant 
benefits to end-users. 
New suppliers entering the market only account for a combined 0.4% of the 
entire electricity sector, Enron said, criticizing the fact that power plant 
facilities are mainly concentrated among electric power companies. 
Regarding prices, an official representing operators of power generation 
facilities asserted that ""industrial-use electricity prices in Japan are 
stuck at a high level at around Y13 per kilowatt, compared with Y5 in the 
U.S., Y3 in Canada, Y9 in Germany and Y4-Y8 in Southeast Asia."" 
In fact, department store operator Takashimaya Co. (8233 or J.TKA), which 
last November switched to new market entrants for part of its electricity 
supply, was able to cut costs by Y450 million in the first year, said a 
company official. 
Enron hopes to generate competition by urging Japanese electric utilities to 
spin off different operations, analysts say. If the number of power 
generation facility operators increases, this will help bolster Japan's 
electricity trading market, an area in which Enron has a strong business 
interest. 
Splitting electricity operations into generation, transmission and 
distribution is expected to open the electric utility network to new 
entrants. This will boost transparency in the fees that electric power 
companies charge for transmitting power on behalf of the operators of power 
generation facilities, Enron says. 
Citing the power shortage in California, however, Japan's electricity sector 
has strongly opposed such spin-offs, stating that generation and distribution 
must be part of a single continuum to ensure a stable supply.

Enron Agrees to Provide Market Data to NGX

05/15/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

CALGARY, May 15 /PRNewswire/ - NGX Canada Inc. (NGX), a wholly owned 
subsidiary of OM AB (OM), today announced that an arrangement has been made 
with Enron Canada Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. (Enron), 
whereby trading data from certain contracts listed on Enron's online trading 
system, EnronOnline will be included in the computation of three Alberta Gas 
Price Indices. 
NGX acquired the AECO ""C"" & NIT Daily Spot, One-Month Spot, and Bid-Week Spot 
gas price indices (Alberta Gas Price Indices) from Canadian Enerdata Ltd. 
last September. Subsequent to the acquisition of the Alberta Gas Price 
Indices, NGX has provided real-time information to its customers on the 
establishment of the weighted average price indices based on transactions 
conducted through NGX's trading system. Canadian Enerdata Limited continues 
to publish the Alberta Gas Price Indices in the Canadian Gas Price Reporter.
Peter Krenkel, President of NGX, stated, ""We believe that inclusion of data 
from EnronOnline will serve to make our price indices among the best in North 
America. The industry has been very supportive of the visibility and 
integrity we are able to bring to the Alberta Gas Price Indices, which 
removes the guesswork around gas price index methodology. However, after 
reviewing the matter with Enron and other industry participants, we 
recognized that Enron had legitimate concerns and the industry felt that 
""more is better"". The inclusion of data from the highly liquid EnronOnline 
system should improve the quality of our price indices even further."" 
Rob Milnthorp, President and CEO of Enron Canada commented, ""We are very 
pleased to have EnronOnline transactions included in the Alberta Gas Price 
Indices. This will provide industry participants with a more comprehensive 
source of data and a better opportunity to manage risk around these price 
indices as they are now assured that all their transactions on EnronOnline 
will be included in the computation of the Alberta Price Indices."" 
The inclusion of EnronOnline data satisfies the principal claims made by 
Enron in their legal action against NGX, Canadian Enerdata Ltd., OM and 
Richard Zarzeczny and Enron has agreed to discontinue the legal action 
against those parties with the conclusion of this arrangement. 
NGX and Enron are planning to implement the necessary system changes by 
August 1, 2001 but in any event will provide at least thirty days notice to 
the industry. Once in operation, data from transactions in the relevant 
contracts listed on EnronOnline will be fed to NGX in real-time. The 
methodology for computing the Alberta Gas Price Indices will continue to be 
on a weighted-average basis. 
NGX will engage independent auditors to insure full compliance with the Index 
Methodology Guide. This guide is available on NGX's website at www.ngx.com.

UAE To Seek New Partners If Enron Exits Dolphin Gas Proj

05/15/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- If U.S.-based Enron Corp. (ENE) pulls out of the $3.5 
billion Dolphin gas project, in which the company holds a 24.5% stake, the 
U.A.E. Offsets Group, or UOG, will consider other companies to replace it, a 
United Arab Emirates industry source close to the project said Tuesday. 
Industry sources Monday said Enron is considering withdrawing from the 
project because it doesn't believe it will be profitable.
Dolphin, an agreement signed two years ago by UOG and Qatar Petroleum, plans 
to bring 2 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from Qatar's offshore 
North Field to Abu Dhabi and onward to Dubai. 
Enron and TotalFinaElf (TOT) each hold a 24.5% stake in the project, while 
UOG owns the remaining 51%. 
Enron is set to focus on the midstream part of the project - gas 
transportation - which requires building a 350-kilometer pipeline from a 
processing plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar, to the Taweelah terminal in Abu Dhabi 
and the Jebel Ali terminal in Dubai. 
The U.A.E. source said originally, it was thought that the U.A.E. government 
would fund the pipeline, which is estimated to cost around $1 billion. 
However, more recently, the source said the U.A.E. suggested that Enron put 
up the money itself. 
Other industry sources said Enron and TotalFinaElf also had to pay 
significant fees to join the project. TotalFinaElf will
operate the upstream part of the project, which includes developing
natural gas reserves in two blocks of the North Field. First wells are 
scheduled to be drilled in the second half of 2001 and come onstream in 
2005. 

Last week, the Middle East Economic Survey reported that the foreign partners 
haven't yet agreed on the precise details of their working relationship or on 
the price of the pipeline. 
Qatar Petroleum and Dolphin Energy Ltd., a subsidiary of UOG, signed an 
initial agreement in March for the upstream section of the project. A full 
agreement is expected to be concluded in September, the source said.

Enron Should Sell Utility to Oregon, Lawmaker Argues (Update2)

Enron Should Sell Utility to Oregon, Lawmaker Argues (Update2)

     (Updates with closing share prices.)

     Washington, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. should sell
Portland General Electric Co. to Oregon so state consumers can be
insulated from soaring electricity prices, a congressman said.
     ``Purchasing PGE would give Oregon ratepayers more control by
keeping its assets in Oregon, accountable solely to Oregonians,''
U.S. Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat from Springfield,
Oregon, said in a letter to Governor John Kitzhaber.
     The governor is considering DeFazio's proposal, said
Kitzhaber spokesman Kevin Smith.
     Last month, Houston-based Enron, the biggest energy trader,
agreed to cancel the $3.1 billion sale of Portland General, a
utility with more than 700,000 Oregon customers, to Sierra Pacific
Resources of Reno, Nevada.
     Enron and Sierra Pacific blamed laws spawned by high power
prices and electricity shortages in the West for the sale's
collapse.
     ``We are pleased to keep Portland General in our asset
portfolio because it's a solid earnings performer,'' Enron
spokeswoman Karen Denne said. ``If approached by a buyer who
recognizes its value, we'd consider selling it.'' She declined to
comment on a potential bid by Oregon.
     The state should act swiftly, DeFazio said, citing press
reports that the U.K.'s Scottish Power Plc, owner of PacifiCorp,
the largest utility in the U.S Northwest, may bid for Portland
General.
     Scottish Power, based in Glasgow, Scotland, would have more
than 70 percent of Oregon electricity customers if it added
Portland General, raising ``serious regulatory concerns about
market power,'' he said.

                            Bond Issue

     Oregon could issue bonds to purchase Portland General, using
the utility's profits to pay the debt, DeFazio said. The state
might run it as a public utility or a cooperative, he said.
     Enron and Sierra Pacific called off the Portland General sale
because of laws passed by Nevada and California legislators that
slow the deregulation of their wholesale power markets.
     California and Nevada have blocked sales of power plants by
utilities. Sierra Pacific had to sell a stake in a Nevada power
plant that sells power to California to win regulatory approval of
the Portland General purchase.
     Average power prices on the California-Oregon border this
year have soared ninefold to $296.34 a megawatt hour over the year-
earlier period. A megawatt hour can light 750 average California
homes for an hour.
     Shares of Enron fell $1.76 to $$56.99. They've fallen 31
percent this year.
     Sierra Pacific rose 9 cents to $16.09. Scottish Power rose 9
pence to 492 ($7) in London.



Enron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1)

Enron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1)

     (Adds closing share price.)

     Houston, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's
biggest energy trader, agreed to provide natural-gas pricing
information to NGX Canada Inc. and drop a C$100 million
($64.7 million) suit against the Canadian gas exchange.
     Enron sued NGX in November after the Internet exchange, a
unit of the company that owns the Stockholm Stock Exchange,
changed providers of its gas-pricing data and didn't include
trades on EnronOnline, Enron's Internet exchange, when calculating
gas-price indexes.
     Calgary-based NGX agreed to include EnronOnline trades in
calculating its Alberta Gas Price Indices by August, Enron
spokesman Eric Thode said.
     NGX, owned by Stockholm's OM Gruppen AB, is used by about 90
percent of Canadian gas traders, and many traders use EnronOnline
to sell gas from western Canada, the biggest supplier of the
cleaner-burning fuel to the U.S.

Hawk vote for California firm unanimous 
Montgomery Watson pegged for water plant 
By MARY FLOOD 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
The Houston Area Water Corp. voted unanimously Monday to grant a $92 million 
contract to a California-based firm to design, build and operate a Lake 
Houston water plant. 
City Council soon will receive the contract for its approval. The 
administration of Mayor Lee Brown was believed to have favored Montgomery 
Watson's chief competitor, Azurix Corp., an arm of local energy giant Enron 
Corp. 
The water corporation, known as ""the Hawk,"" voted 5-0 to grant the contract. 
If approved by City Council, the contract would give the company 2 1/2 years 
to get the plant up and treating raw lake water. 
It was initially expected that the plant, which will be designed to handle 40 
million gallons of water daily, could cost as much as $150 million to build. 
The Hawk board asked the vying companies to modify their bids several times, 
and that caused the competitors to lower their prices. 
The contract calls for the Hawk to pay a monthly operating fee of $157,000 
when the plant is working. And Montgomery Watson could be required to 
construct, at the Hawk's option, an additional 40 million-gallon-a-day plant 
expansion for $32 million. 
But the details of how the plant will be financed have not been determined. 
The Hawk board discussed borrowing money using the city's credit rating on a 
short-term basis until it could develop long-term financing by selling bonds 
itself. 
The initial customer for the water is the city of Houston, which would repay 
the Hawk the cost of producing the treated water. The hope is that the plant 
eventually will provide water to other entities in the area as well. This 
plant is part of an area plan for the treatment of surface water that could 
cost about $2 billion to implement. 
City Councilman Carroll Robinson, who heads the council infrastructure 
committee, said he expects to hold two hearings about the contract. One would 
focus on how the Hawk board picked Montgomery Watson. A series of three 
recommendations from City Hall staff recommended Azurix. 
Hawk board members said Montgomery Watson's prices were lower by millions and 
that Azurix plans to sell Azurix North America, the body that would oversee 
this contract. 
The second City Council hearing will focus on financing, Robinson said. ""In 
my mind, how the city will pay for this construction is as important as who 
will do it,"" Robinson said. 
The Hawk board, appointed by Brown and approved by City Council, has been 
heavily lobbied by the contenders for the job. 
Because City Council does not have to follow the Hawk recommendation, new 
pressure has begun at City Hall. The third bidder, U.S. Filter Operating 
Services, part of a French company, has been heavily lobbying some council 
members to switch the contract to it. 
Some members of the Azurix team -- people at companies that would have gotten 
work had Azurix gotten the job -- have written letters complaining about the 
Hawk procedures as well. 
John M. Stokes, president and chief executive officer of Azurix, penned the 
first such distressed missive. In April, he wrote to Hawk board Chairman 
David Berg complaining of the ""deleterious economic effect"" on Azurix of the 
board's decision to negotiate with Montgomery Watson. He requested that Berg 
answer a series of questions in writing explaining why Azurix didn't get the 
job. Berg didn't do so. 
Although that letter had a threatening tone, Amanda Martin, president of 
Azurix North America, said no threat was intended and the letter simply 
indicated how upset the team was when it first learned Azurix wasn't chosen. 
Azurix was the rumored front-runner for months. 


		

		
		
		
		INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY: Enron may cut stake in Gulf gas project 
Financial Times; May 15, 2001
By ROBIN ALLEN

		There are growing fears that Enron, the US power company, may withdraw or 
sharply reduce its stake in the Gulf's Dollars 10bn Dolphin gas export 
scheme, one of the most ambitious of its kind in the region. 
		Enron officials have refused to comment on reports that the company is 
reconsidering its position as a minority shareholder in Dolphin Energy, in 
which France's TotalFinaElf (TFE) also has 24.5 per cent. 
		However, one industry specialist said yesterday Enron was talking of 
""selling"" at least part of its shareholding. 
		The threat raises critical issues for western companies seeking to profit 
from accessing state-owned oil and gas in the Gulf. 
		The project was launched two years ago by Abu Dhabi, the wealthiest of the 
United Arab Emirates, to promote energy security for the Gulf. But Abu 
Dhabiis seen as a prime example of a state where prestige and opaque domestic 
political considerations can be as important as profitability in such a 
large-scale project, especially in the early stages. 
		Dolphin's majority owner is UAE's Offsets Group (UOG), an offshoot of Abu 
Dhabi's defence procurement industry. In March, Dolphin, a relative newcomer 
on Abu Dhabi's energy scene, signed a Dollars 3.5bn agreement with Qatar to 
exploit and pipe up to 2bn cubic feet a day of gas from Qatar's prolific 
North Field to Abu Dhabi. 
		Qatari gas is the source of Abu Dhabi's long-term energy strategy, and Enron
's role was to develop, at a profit, the downstream section, primarily to 
construct and lay the 350km pipeline from Qatar to Abu Dhabi. 
		Enron is not a specialist in energy production or pipeline fabrication, but 
one of its main aims, according to one analyst, was to gain access to the gas 
accruing to it from the Qatar deal and then trade it on. Sheikh Zayed Bin 
Sultan al-Nahyan, Abu Dhabi's ruler, disapproves of commodity trading. 
		""If the Qatar-UAE gas deal was going to be profitable"" for western energy 
majors, asked one senior western diplomat, ""then why are the serious US 
energy majors not involved?"" For more reports see www.ft.com/globaleconomy

JAPAN: Enron says high power rates costing Japan.

05/15/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

TOKYO, May 15 (Reuters) - A senior executive of U.S. energy giant Enron Corp 
said on Tuesday that Japan could save an estimated four trillion yen ($32.45 
billion) in annual costs if electricity rates were cut to the average of 
members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). 
""If you were to pare Japanese industrial electric rates to the OECD 
average...savings to all...customers would be about four trillion yen per 
year,"" Enron Corp Vice President Steven Kean told a seminar in Tokyo.
Speaking at a seminar on electric power deregulation, Kean said that 
indigenous factors such as steep land prices and a lack of natural energy 
resources were often blamed for Japan's high electricity rates. 
But he said these factors were not sufficient to explain Japan's high 
electricity rates. 
A report commissioned by Enron Japan Corp showed that in 1998 Japan's 
electricity rates for industrial users were 16.81 yen per kilowatt hour (kWh) 
compared to a second highest rate of 12.44 yen in Italy. 
Japan's business sector has expressed concern at the nation's high 
electricity rates, saying that it blunts their competitive edge on the 
international market. 
Kean also drew parallels between Japan, in the midst of deregulation, and 
California which has been suffering from a power shortage since deregulating 
its market in 1998. 
These included the length of time that authorities in Japan took to issue 
permits to allow the construction of new power plants, he said. 
""The regulatory structure in Japan is very strict...just like in California,"" 
Kean said. 
North America's biggest buyer and seller of electricity, Enron gained its 
first foothold in Japan in 1999 when it established affiliate E Power Corp. 
In April of last year, it set up subsidiary Enron Japan Corp. 
Kean urged Japan to step up measures to open up its power market, a process 
he said held many benefits. 
Japan is in the process of deregulating its power market. Since March last 
year, large-lot consumers have been free to chose their suppliers. The 
measure liberalised an estimated 30 percent of the power market and ended 
Japan's 10 power utilities regional monopoly. 
However, industry watchers note that there have been very few new entrants 
and that further deregulation measures must be taken for rates to fall. The 
Japanese government is due to review the process in 2003.

Japan Must Speed Up Pwr Sector Dereg To Lower Rates-Indus

05/15/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

TOKYO -(Dow Jones)- Japan should accelerate the ongoing electric power sector 
deregulation to fully liberalize the retail market, in order to bring down 
the country's high power rates while ensuring stable power supply, experts 
said at an industry seminar Tuesday. 
The pressure is mounting for Japan's 10 power utilities, which have long 
enjoyed regional monopolies until a year ago, to become cost- effective and 
performance-conscious after the government partially liberalized the retail 
power market in March 2000.
However, the current scheme has so far failed to lure a large number of 
potential entrants because of the high transmission fees they must pay to 
conventional power companies. 
""What happened in overseas (power industries) suggest that the liberalization 
in Japan wouldn't only lower power rates but would also contribute to stable 
power supply significantly,"" said Tatsuo Hatta, professor of economics at the 
University of Tokyo. 
Compared with the U.S., Japanese electricity charges are typically twice as 
much for households and three times higher for industrial users. 
""There is a large discrepancy (in rates), and that is why we should hurriedly 
implement the liberalization,"" Hatta said. 
He said Japan's steep seasonal peak-load curve - one of the reasons the power 
companies cite as the cause of high power rates in Japan - can be altered 
once the prices are liberalized. ""If power rates are set higher during those 
peak hours following the liberalization, users would refrain from using 
electricity."" 
Steven Kean, executive vice president of the U.S. energy major, Enron Corp. 
(ENE), told the same seminar that Japan's power costs remain on the upward 
trend despite cost reductions in Europe and the U.S. 
He said Japan could achieve a cost-saving of Y4 trillion a year if its power 
prices fall to levels in Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development countries following the liberalization. 
Hatta and Kean were speaking at the seminar called ""Reassessing Power 
Deregulation,"" which was co-sponsored by the Houston-based Enron. 

Hatta of the University of Tokyo said ""it's very wise"" that Japan has begun 
the deregulation with the ""bilateral supply, or trade"" system under which 
suppliers and users clinch deals directly. 
Under the current reforms, the sector for high-volume, large-lot industrial 
and commercial users - which represents only 30% of the Y15 trillion market - 
is opened to free competition. The government is to review the partial 
deregulation by 2003 for further deregulation. 
Japan should then introduce spot electricity trading such as futures and 
derivatives to alleviate risks of complicated price volatility for power 
providers, Hatta said. 
Hatta and other experts attending the seminar said further deregulation 
should destroy the systems that have supported the country's high power rates 
- regional monopolies and the fair rate return method, under which all costs 
are levied on prices. 
""There is absolutely no need to set the same (power) prices"" nationwide, 
Hatta said. Power companies should make the opaque transmission fees 
transparent and set them accordingly with regional demand, he said. 
Yoshinori Omuro, vice president of Takashimaya Co.'s (J.TKA or 8233) 
management department, acknowledged the slow progress of the deregulation. 
Takashimaya, a major department store operator, has shifted to Diamond Power 
Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corp. (J.MIB or 8058) as its 
power supplier at two of its 18 stores, with ""strong back-up"" from the 
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. 
""Despite the deregulation, the situation isn't where we can negotiate with 
power utilities to reduce (electricity costs). We have no choice but select 
independent power providers,"" Omuro said.

SINGAPORE: ANALYSIS-No Asia fallout seen from Enron's India woes.
By Cameron Dueck

05/15/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SINGAPORE, May 15 (Reuters) - A bitter payment battle between U.S. energy 
giant Enron Corp and authorities in India will serve as a reminder to foreign 
investors of the risks of putting money into emerging markets, analysts and 
bankers say. 
But it is unlikely to deter the flow of money into Asian electricity projects.
The pace of power privatisation and deregulation varies too greatly from 
country to country for the controversy in India to chill investment activity 
across Asia, they say. 
It does, however, underline the risks companies take despite some security 
offered by government payment guarantees. 
""Independant power producers (IPPs) will see Enron and Dabhol as an 
illustration of the dangers and possible risks of investing in an emerging 
market, but it would be going too far to say that other markets will be 
adversely affected because of it,"" said Philip Jackson, a banker with JP 
Morgan Chase in Hong Kong. 
Enron is on the verge of bailing out of an almost completed $2.9 billion 
power project because of a decade-long dispute with the troubled Maharashtra 
State Electricity Board (MSEB) over pricing and unpaid bills. 
MSEB has fallen about six months behind in paying for electricity supplied by 
Dabhol Power Co, the Indian unit of Houston-based Enron. 
The utility said last month that it had repaid about $28.6 million of the 
$48.2 million outstanding. 
The board of Dabhol has authorised the management to stop selling power to 
MSEB if the dispute is not resolved. Local media reports earlier in May said 
Enron was pulling executives out of India and relocating them elsewhere. 
Dabhol has invoked payment guarantees issued by the state and federal 
governments, but neither has stepped forward to foot the bill. 
GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES 
Banks often demand sponsor or host government guarantees to lessen risk 
before financing energy projects, which have long lead times and high capital 
expenditure. 
Governments are keen to provide guarantees to attract foreign investment. 
Guarantees may cover shortfalls in production, default of customer payment or 
even changes in market conditions. 
But such guarantees do not always provide the desired safety net and analysts 
said the legal systems in many emerging nations are simply not efficient 
enough to back these agreements. 
Enron's experience in India highlighted the risks of power investment in 
emerging countries and the unpredictability of government guarantees, they 
said. 
""Guarantees like that are painful for companies and for polititicians they're 
even more so,"" said John Vautrain, vice president at Purvin & Gertz in 
Singapore. 
""If the call is substantial, it's going to be bad."" 
Robert Booth, director of the Bardak Group in West Perth, Australia, was more 
pessimistic and reckoned some companies might take a lead from Enron and shy 
away from emerging Asian nations. 
""Investors will pull back from these countries until they see that there is a 
properly functioning legal system that gives them assurance if they have to 
call in a government guarantee,"" Booth said.

MANAMA, Bahrain -(Dow Jones)- Saudi Arabia's supreme petroleum council is 
expected to hold a meeting Tuesday evening, but it's unlikely to declare its 
choice of international oil companies to participate in downstream gas 
projects, Arabic al-Hayat newspaper reported. 
The newspaper quoted sources at the government's technical committee 
overseeing the proposed projects as saying that the committee hasn't 
completed its final report concerning the oil companies' offers.
""Studies and recommendations haven't been completed yet and they need some 
time in order to present the project at its final structure, attached with 
recommendations from the technical committee,"" the sources said, according to 
the newspaper. 
However, the oil council ""might endorse some balances concerning the offers,"" 
the newspaper said but didn't elaborate further. 
Sources in Saudi Arabia have said the oil companies were expected to be 
notified soon on whether they have been selected to participate in the gas 
projects. 
Saudi Arabia invited international oil companies in October 1998 to 
participate in proposals for downstream gas projects and upstream gas 
enhancement. 
After a series of meetings between the negotiating committee and the oil 
companies in the past year, several companies were shortlisted for each 
project. 
The companies shortlisted for Core Venture 1, the $15 billion South Ghawar 
Area Development were Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD), BP PLC (BP), Exxon Mobil 
Corp. (XOM), Chevron Corp. (CHV), Total Fina Elf S.A. (TOT) and ENI SpA (E). 
For Core Venture 2, the Red Sea Development, Enron Corp. (ENE) and Occidental 
Petroleum Corp. (OXY) are bidding jointly and Exxon Mobil, Total Fina Elf, 
Marathon Oil Canada Inc. (T.M), Shell and Conoco Inc. (COCA) were 
shortlisted. 
And for Core Venture 3, the Shaybah area, Total Fina Elf, Conoco, Phillips 
Petroleum (P), Enron and Occidental, Exxon Mobil, Shell and Marathon Oil were 
shortlisted.

MSEB refutes allegations by Enron, DPC
Girish Kuber

Copyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)

MUMBAI 
THE MAHARASHTRA State Electricity Board on Monday in a letter to Enron 
refuted all allegations made against it by the company while invoking the 
political force majeure.
Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company on April 9 had invoked the political 
force majeure clause. DPC had indicated it was not in a position to fulfil 
its contractual obligations to MSEB because of political circumstances beyond 
its control. 
MSEB in a reply on Monday denied Enron's allegation of 'political 
circumstances' and said there was no reason why it should have felt insecure. 
""Such a step was necessary under the Power Purchase Agreement and related 
security documents to notify the board of 'certain events and to enforce our 
rights',"" DPC had said. However, according to MSEB, such a step by DPC was 
uncalled for. 
For DPC, invoking the force majeure clause was necessary as 'certain events 
occurred that are beyond the reasonable control of the affected party (DPC)'. 
MSEB has expressed surprise in a letter on Monday. 
The energy major had dispatched the notice to MSEB, as an affected party, 
which had been subjected to ""concerted, deliberate and politically motivated 
actions of state government, the Government of India and the Board, which 
will have a material and adverse effect on DPC's ability to perform 
obligations under PPA"". 
""Given the cumulative effect of these political actions, DPC determined that 
the political force majeure declaration is an appropriate mechanism for 
providing that notice, and that is an appropriate and necessary step in 
protecting DPC and its stakeholders' rights,"" the statement added. 
However, for MSEB this was 'yet another move' from Enron to avoid paying Rs 
402 crore penalty the MSEB has slapped on it for failing to supply 
electricity as per the agreement. 
MSEB, in today's letter, reiterated its suggestion to adjust December 2000 
and Januray 2001 bills, against the Rs 800 crore penalty it has slapped on 
Enron for not supplying electricity as per demand. 
MSEB has refused to pay DPC's December 2000 and January 2001 bills worth Rs 
213 crore.

RIYADH : Saudi Arabia's Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC) is holding meetings 
on bids by 12 foreign oil majors for three giant gas projects and should take 
a decision shortly, a top oil official said on Monday. ""The SPC has been 
discussing recommendations by the negotiating committee about the bids, and 
the meetings will continues executive president of the committee Abdulrahman 
al-Suhaibani told AFP. 
""It is not clear yet when the discussions will be completed and wham a final 
decision will be issued,"" added Suhaibani, who expected it to be soon. The 
meetings began two weeks ago.
A senior foreign oil executive in the kingdom expected an answer to his 
firm's bid by the end of this week or the start of next week. 
""The SPC is holding a crucial meeting today (Monday) and tomorrow. bin were 
told we would get an answer to our proposals either this weekend or early 
next week,"" the executive told AFP. 
The negotiating committee made detailed recommendations after meeting with 
the representative of 12 international oil companies (IOCs) which are bidding 
for the three multi-billion projects, the executive said. 
The committee, comprising ministers who are also SPC members, is headed by 
Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal. 
The gas projects, which would be the first foreign investment 
in the kingdom's energy sector since nationalisation in 1961, are located in 
the South Ghawar field near Al-Hufuf in the Eastern Province, Shaybah in the 
Empty Quarter desert, and the northern Red Sea area. 
They cover 440,000 square kilometres (176,000 square miles), making it the 
world's largest area for hydrocarbon investment. 
US majors Enron and Occidental in a joint bid, as well as Chevron, 
Conocokilometres, ExxonMobil, Marathon, Phillips and Texaco have been 
shortlisted for the Saudi projects. Rounding out the list are European firms 
BP Amoco, Eni, Royal Dutch Shell and TotalFinaElf. 
ExxonMobil, Shell and TotalFinaElf are in the bidding for all three ventures. 
The investment involves gas exploration and production, setting up 
petrochemical industries and power and water desalination plants. 
The projects, called the natural gas initiative, are to be carried out 
simultaneously by consortia of two to three firms in cooperation with Aramco, 
the national oil company, on long-term basis for up to 30 years, the 
executive said. 
Aramco has been working to double the Saudi gas network's capacity from the 
current 3.5 billion cubic feet (105 million cubic metres) per day to seven 
billion cubic feet (210 million metres) daily in 2004. 
Saudi Arabia, which sits on top of the world's biggest oil reserves, has 
proven natural gas reserves of 220 trillion cubic feet (6.6 trillion cubic 
metres).-AFP

Electricity Trading Builds Oh-So Slowly In France
By Sarah Wachter
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

03/23/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

PARIS -(Dow Jones)- Although electricity trading volumes are creeping higher 
in France, activity will probably remain subdued and irregular until a 
satisfactory regulatory regime is put in place. 
Traders complain about the uncertainty caused by the temporary rules of grid 
operator RTE, and about tariffs for access to the network. Volumes won't take 
off without well-designed, permanent rules, they said.
Even then Europe's second-largest electricity market may never become much of 
a trading hub because of the dominance of state utility Electricity de France 
(F.EDF) which, with its huge installed nuclear capacity, is already among 
Europe's cheapest electricity suppliers. 
""There's so much missing,"" said Katrin Durwald, an energy analyst with HEW 
Energy Trading, talking about RTE's tariffs and rules.""Nothing is really 
clear in France,"" she said. 
Traders are especially upset over RTE's congestion costs, which only new 
market entrants share and which can add as much as 50% to the price of 
electricity. 
Other traders say access charges to the medium- to low-voltage network are 
impossible to figure out. But permanent tariffs won't go into effect until 
July 1 at the earliest, French electricity regulator CRE says. 
Permanent grid rules won't reach the regulator's desk for review until early 
summer, reckons RTE President Andre Merlin. 
Even with clearer regulation, the dominance of EDF will hold back the market. 
Former monopoly supplier EDF is a formidable competitor, a predominantly 
nuclear power producer with some of the lowest electricity prices in Europe. 
Traders estimate between 20 and 50 trades are going through monthly in 
France, mostly for electricity delivered the next day or next week. 
That's a far cry from neighboring Germany before the launch of spot 
electricity exchanges there, when 160 short-term transactions were struck 
daily, HEW Energy Trading estimates. 
More immediately, what's missing in France is a steady stream of one-year 
supply deals, a sign that foreign power companies are regularly furnishing 
electricity to French industrial consumers. 
""I seriously doubt whether there are companies taking risk and supplying 
customers,"" a trader with a large European power company said. 
French high-voltage grid operator RTE said 325 grid access contracts were 
signed this year for all transactions, as of March 12, equilavent to an 
average of four of five deals a day. 
There are, nonetheless, some pockets of activity in France. 
Traders are exchanging blocks of electricity to help industrial consumers 
curb costly imbalance charges, by grouping the companies' electricity needs 
to even out consumption patterns. 
RTE says 21 companies are authorized to furnish or buy back imbalance 
electricity. 
Swiss hydro producers are also exporting spot electricity to France, analysts 
said, notably Elektrizitaetsgesellschaft Laufenburg AG (Z.EGL) and 
Aare-Tessin AG fuer Elektrizitaet (Z.AAR). 
""Germany and France are the biggest export countries for Swiss spot hydro,"" 
Durwald said. 
At the same time, two Dutch energy distributors, NUON NV (N.NUN) and REMU NV, 
have been active in France, traders said. 
NUON purchased a few small hydroelectric producers, which are bound under an 
eight-year contract to sell electricity exclusively to EDF. 
But NUON can sell electricity to new customers above the contract price EDF 
is obliged to pay under its single buyer obligation, Durwald said. 
Some traders see opportunities cropping up this year from changes to the way 
transport capacity is allocated on France's interconnectors with the U.K. and 
with Italy. 
""Cogenerators (gas-fired power plants) in France with surplus capacity could 
sell to traders in Germany looking to import electricity into Italy,"" a 
trader at a large pan-European trading organization said. 
RTE forbids electricity ordered and delivered on the same day sourced from 
Germany and Switzerland to be imported to Italy. 
That trader also expects the daily transfer capacity auction on the 
U.K.-France Interconnector, which starts March 31, to spark more electricity 
trading in both countries. 
""The day-ahead risk is rather limited, not only in France but also in the 
U.K.,"" he said. 
The following are traders and power companies said to be active in France, in 
addition to those concerns already mentioned in the article, according to a

India: Dabhol guarantee: Govt awaiting Law Ministry view

Asia Intelligence Wire

NEW DELHI, March 22. THE Government is awaiting the opinion of the Law 
Ministry on the claim of the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) for the bill of Rs 
102 crore under the counter-guarantee cover, for the 740-MW Dabhol power 
project, before deciding on making the next payment to the utility. 
The Union Government has sought the opinion of the Law Ministry, as the 
Maharashtra Government had written to it, suggesting that the claim should 
not be honoured, as the DPC had not complied with load despatch instructions.
The Law Ministry's views are crucial to any decision on going in later for 
future course of action which could be either arbitration or High Court 
proceedings. 
The Government has sought an early response from the Law Ministry as the 
15-day interest free period for payment of DPCs's contentious bill for the 
month of December 2000 ends on Friday. 
According to the counter guarantee agreement, the Government will have to pay 
with interest (at Bank rate) the outstandings, if it is paid after 15 days of 
the receipt of the notice to the Government of India. 
The Government has one month's time from the date of presentation of the 
claim by the company to meet its obligations. 
Last time, the Maharashtra Government managed to make a payment to the MSEB 
in the nick of time, after DPC invoked the guarantee. 
This time the cause for conflict is the counter claim put forth by the 
Maharashtra Government seeking a rebate of Rs 400 crore from the power 
project sponsors. 
The conflict hinges on a technical issue involving legal interpretation of 
the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between the Maharashtra State Electricity 
Board and project developers led by Enron. 
MSEB's contention is that the PPA requires Enron to make available power 
corresponding to 90 per cent 'Plant Availability' within a period of three 
hours of the requisition. 
On a particular day in January, Dabhol took five hours to achieve this task, 
according to the MSEB. Hence, MSEB has sought rebate as penalty for non 
compliance of despatch instructions. 
DPC, meanwhile, has contended that the despatch instructions were not in the 
format prescribed in the PPA.

India: Foreign companies facing tax harassment: Japanese envoy

Asia Intelligence Wire

CHENNAI, March 22. THE Japanese Ambassador in India, Mr Hiroshi Hirabayashi, 
today complained that there were ""numerous instances"" of foreign companies 
established in India, being harassed by tax officials. 
Delivering a speech at the Indo-Japan Centre here, Mr Hirabayashi that the 
tax collectors ""seem to view foreign companies as an easy prey from whom they 
could collect as much as possible without being bothered by political 
pressure.""
Out ""of frustration and decreased chance of making profit, not a few Japanese 
companies have closed their businesses."" 
Mr Hirabayashi said he had taken up the matter with the Finance Minister, Mr 
Yashwant Sinha, and had given the message that ""tax officers are indeed 
killing the goose that lay golden eggs."" 
In a particularly blunt speech, Mr Hirabayashi said one of the reasons why 
Japanese companies are hesitant to invest in India is because ""what they hear 
is mostly sob-stories, stories of hardships faced by foreign investors."" 
Foreign companies are carefully watching the development of Enron and 
Suzuki-Maruti ventures, for instance, he said. 
Japanese companies found East and South-East Asian countries more 
investor-friendly and preferred to invest there. 
The Ambassador cited two more reasons for poor Japanese investments in India: 
poor infrastructure and red- tapism. ""While the single window system for 
foreign investment is set up, yet, when a foreign investor actually 
establishes a new venture, he has to use much nerve and money in obtaining 
plethora of clearances and permissions."" 
Mr Hirabayashi was also critical of the investment climate in Maharashtra, 
where ""foreign companies are constantly hammered by unlawful elements."" 
On the other hand, he spoke warmly of Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra 
Pradesh, mentioning the names of the Chief Ministers by name. 
He said that he found in their attitude ""perceptible changes for the better.""

'Panel to clear Tannir Bhavi project deal'
The Times of India News Service

The Times of India
Copyright (C) 2001 The Times of India; Source: World Reporter (TM)

BANGALORE: The controversial Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) on the 410 MW 
Tannir Bhavi barge-mounted project will be submitted for approval to the 
Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC), Power Minister Veerakumar 
A. Patil told the Assembly on Thursday. 
Replying to the debate on the power tariff hike, Patil said: ``As soon as 
generation is started at Tannir Bhavi, the PPA will go to the KERC. All PPAs 
have to be cleared by the KERC before implementation.''
Earlier, A. Ramdas (BJP) alleged that the Karnataka Power Transmission 
Corporation (KPTC) had to pay a steep Rs 5.63 per unit for Tannir Bhavi power 
as per the terms of the PPA. 
``Even if we don't buy the power, we have to pay Rs 650 crore, in dollars, 
absorbing the differences in the price of naphta, as per the PPA. What is the 
government's vested interest in this project?'' he asked. 
Patil said the PPA, which includes escrow cover, had to be honoured following 
a direction from the Karnataka High Court. ``We are facing power shortage, 
specially at the height of summer, and are buying power from wherever 
possible. The KPTC Chairman and I are going to Delhi to see if we can get 
more power from the central grid,'' he added. 
Maharashtra had offered power at Rs 3.90 per unit from Enron. ``It is 
expensive, but if we have no alternative, we will buy power from them,'' he 
indicated. 
Referring to the bribery case in the 220 KV Kadra project, he seven of the 
eight accused had been arrested. ``Director (Distribution) Vijaybhaskar, 
however, has taken anticipatory bail,'' he added. 
Responding to Araga Jnanendra's (BJP) allegation that the government had 
handed over the Mavalagi project across Kali river to a independent power 
producer instead of the profit-making and government-owned Karnataka Power 
Corporation (KPC), Patil said: ``The KPC has taken a policy decision not to 
go for projects below 250 MW.'' 
The minister ruled out subsidies to sectors other than agriculture, for which 
the government has agreed to release Rs 144 crore to KPTC. ``There are review 
petitions from other sectors before the KERC, which will decide. But the 
government is not in a position to give any more money,'' he maintained.

USA: Transmission Texas' only dereg hurdle-state grid manager.
By C. Bryson Hull

03/22/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, March 22 (Reuters) - Improving power transmission capacity is the 
biggest challenge Texas faces heading into deregulation next year, the 
manager of the state's power grid said on Thursday. 
California's Achilles' heel, a lack of generating capacity, is not Texas' 
problem, Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) chief executive 
officer Tom Noel said.
""Capacity is not the only issue. Serving this 200,000 square miles of 
territory and 6 million customers requires an awful lot of transmission, 
distribution and wire,"" Noel said in a speech at the Houston Energy Expo. 
""Also important are the constraints that exist."" 
Currently, has 65,000 MW of generation and a 2000 peak summer load of around 
57,000 MW. Twenty-two new power plants have been built in Texas in the past 
five years, 15 are under construction and 30 are on the drawing board, he 
said. 
Moving that power from often remote plants to the biggest markets presents a 
challenge, particularly in four areas served by ERCOT, which manages 85 
percent of the Texas power grid. 
""You can't get it from there to here,"" Noel said of the trouble spots. 
Transmission constraints exist in moving power from the south to the north, 
where fast-growing Dallas creates a high demand; inside Dallas itself; from 
the Rio Grande Valley to Austin and San Antonio in Central Texas; and from 
lightly populated West Texas to the eastern half of the state. 
In the last case, several companies including Enron Corp. have committed to 
building wind power facilities out on the western plains, to supply power to 
the more densely populated eastern half of Texas. 
INCENTIVES TO BUILD TRANSMISSION 
Though companies have already anted up to erect power lines in the problem 
areas, the state will have to provide attractive rates of return to encourage 
continuing infrastructure investments, he said. 
""The rate of return is going to have to be a little higher than it was in the 
past,"" Noel said. 
He expected that the Texas Public Utility Commission, which negotiates such 
rates with the utilities, would look to a range of 10-12 percent return on 
investment, as opposed to current rates in the neighborhood of eight percent. 
Transmission is the only major part of the state's electricity market which 
will still be regulated after retail deregulation kicks off, he said. The 
wholesale market has been deregulated since 1995. 
""We believe the infrastructure has to be regulated,"" Noel said. 
""Part of our plan is to make sure that someone who owns the wires cannot 
become a market player and cut out people who have power to sell and can't 
get to market because they can't get to the lines,"" he said. 
Under the Texas deregulation plan, generators will sell power directly to 
customers but will send it via wires likely owned by other companies. That is 
part of the reason traditional regulated Texas utilities like TXU Corp. and 
Reliant Energy Inc. are splitting their regulated and unregulated businesses 
into separate entities. 
Noel said ERCOT and the state government are both committed to starting 
deregulation on schedule on Jan. 1, 2002. The first active move toward that 
end comes on April 2, when ERCOT will conduct a mock market. 
Noel acknowledged ""it's not going to be pretty,"" because of some delays in 
setting up the computer hardware and software needed to undertake the testing 
prior to the start date. A pilot program for 5 percent of retail customers is 
next up on June 1.

them out in January."" 
Enron Chief Executive Jeff Skilling is scheduled to have a telephone 
conference with investors at 1 p.m. EST Friday. Palmer said Skilling would 
discuss the bandwidth unit at that meeting. 
In a research report Thursday, Salomon Smith Barney reaffirmed its estimate 
of Enron's earnings and discounted the layoff rumors saying the redeployment 
was for noncommercial personnel. Palmer declined to comment on the Salomon 
Smith Barney report. 
At Aquila Broadband Services, Sushil Nelson expects to add two more traders 
to a staff of eight by the end of this year. 
The broadband unit has 36 employees, said Nelson, who serves as senior vice 
president and general manager. 
""We're looking to hire people with origination experience,"" he said. The 
company has 10 deal originators. Nelson declined to say how many deal 
originators the company plans to add by the end of the year. 
Williams Communications has five traders on its bandwidth desk. 
""As our business evolves, we certainly have room for more people,"" said Chris 
Lemmer, executive director of bandwidth trading and risk management at 
Williams Communications. 
A similar view was taken by Greg Jenkins, chief executive of El Paso Global 
Networks. 
""We are continuing with our strategy and adding commercial people to our 
organization,"" Jenkins said in a statement released by the company. ""We 
believe this is a good moment to be building our business."" 
Jenkins said the company plans to double its trading staff by the end of the 
year. He declined to say how many traders the company currently has.

USA: UPDATE 1-Bush accused of protecting oil firms in power crisis.
By Tom Doggett

03/22/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

WASHINGTON, March 22 (Reuters) - Washington Democratic Senator Patty Murray 
accused the Bush administration on Thursday of caring more about the 
financial interests of big oil companies than trying to protect consumers in 
Western states from the economic effects of high electricity prices and power 
supply shortages. 
""I think it is a real concern to all of us in my home state of Washington and 
the entire West Coast that we have been facing an energy crisis for four 
months now,"" Murray told reporters on Capitol Hill.
""I can only assume the influence of the oil industry in the Bush 
administration is keeping them from helping our economic crisis in the state 
of Washington,"" said Murray, adding that some of her constituents are facing 
a 60 percent surcharge in their electricity bills. 
Energy firms, many of them based in Bush's home state of Texas, supply 
natural gas and electricity to California's utilities. However, some 
suppliers have been reluctant to keep doing business with the nearly-bankrupt 
utilities. 
California's utilities have racked up billions in debts from skyrocketing 
electricity costs that the firms are prohibited from passing on to consumers 
under the state's deregulation law. 
Like President Bush, many of the energy firms oppose a price cap on wholesale 
electricity prices in the West as proposed by California Governor Gray Davis 
and other governors in the region. Bush fears a price cap would discourage 
energy firms from building new power plants. 
""A TOUGH-LUCK APPROACH"" 
""We have an administration that has failed to come forward with a policy...to 
put in place an energy price cap immediately to begin to solve this problem,"" 
Murray said. ""Unfortunately, this administration has advocated a tough-luck 
approach."" 
Murray is co-sponsoring a Democratic energy bill unveiled on Thursday that 
includes language to limit the prices generating companies can charge for 
wholesale power in 11 western states. 
The White House defended the administration's policy against price curbs for 
electricity. ""The reason why we oppose price caps is because they don't work, 
they would make the problem worse by driving away supply and failing to 
promote (energy) conservation,"" White House deputy press secretary Claire 
Buchan said on Thursday. 
Despite Murray's accusations of neglect by the president, Buchan said the 
administration cares how the energy crisis is affecting consumers in the 
West. 
""The president is very sympathetic to the concerns and anxiety of individuals 
in western states as they view the mounting energy issues in that area,"" she 
said. 
Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney were plagued with accusations during last 
year's campaign of being too cozy with big oil firms. 
The oil industry gave millions of dollars to Bush's presidential campaign and 
other Republican races throughout the country last year. 
Bush also depended on advice from executives of several energy firms, 
including natural gas giant Enron Corp. , in developing an energy policy for 
his new administration. 
Bush, a former Texas oilman, has named Vice President Dick Cheney, a former 
top executive of oilfield services giant Halliburton Co. to head a White 
House task force to come up with recommendations to solve America's energy 
problems that includes the West's power crisis.

USA: Enron stock slides despite earnings reassurance.
By Andrew Kelly

03/22/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, March 22 (Reuters) - Shares of electricity and natural gas marketing 
giant Enron Corp. slid further on Thursday amid broader weakness in energy 
stocks despite a reassurance from the company that it would hit its 
previously stated earnings target for this year. 
Enron was off $3.34, or 6 percent, at $52.55 per share Thursday afternoon 
after falling 8 percent on Wednesday. So far this year, Enron's stock is down 
about 37 percent, versus a 16 percent decline for Standard & Poor's utilities 
index.
Seeking to reassure investors, Enron issued a statement on Thursday saying it 
was ""very comfortable"" with its 2001 earnings target of $1.70 to $1.75 per 
diluted share. On average, Wall Street analysts expect Enron to post earnings 
of $1.74 per share, according to data compiled by Thomson Financial/First 
Call. 
The Houston-based company said it was confident about its strong business 
prospects for the year, adding that it would host a conference call for 
analysts and investors on Friday. 
Analysts who track the company said the decline in its stock price did not 
appear to be related to business developments at Enron but rather to poor 
stock market sentiment, particularly in the areas of technology and 
telecommunications. 
""A lot of the breakout in Enron's stock in 2000 was in relation to their 
strategy in new areas like business-to-business and broadband 
telecommunications, and that's just out of favor right now,"" said CIBC World 
Markets analyst William Hyler. 
BUILDING A BROADBAND BUSINESS 
Since early last year Enron has been building a high-speed broadband 
communications network that it plans to use as a base to build a bandwidth 
marketing and trading business similar to its huge natural gas and 
electricity trading operation. 
Excitement among investors about the broadband business and about Enron's 
success in developing a strong Internet-based trading platform for energy and 
other commodities drove an 87 percent rise in the company's share price last 
year, outpacing a gain of 54 percent for the S&P utilities index. 
On Wednesday Enron spokesman Mark Palmer denied rumors of impending layoffs 
at the company's broadband unit, although he confirmed that staff were being 
redeployed within the business. 
Salomon Smith Barney analyst Ray Niles said in a research note that he was 
not concerned about the redeployments, nor about the recent cancellation of a 
deal with Blockbuster Inc. to deliver movies on-demand via Enron's broadband 
network. 
""We have always placed a greater value on the bandwidth trading portion of 
Enron's bandwidth strategy, rather than on content delivery,"" he said. Niles 
maintained a Buy rating on the company's stock and a 12-18 month price target 
of $100. 
Other U.S. energy stocks were also broadly weaker on Thursday, reflecting 
investor's concerns that a global economic slowdown could lead to reduced 
demand for energy and correspondingly lower prices for crude oil and natural 
gas. 
Williams Cos., a company with a business mix similar to Enron's, saw its 
stock decline $3.34, or 8 percent, to $38.10. 
Apache Corp., a leading U.S. oil and gas exploration company, was off $3.02, 
or 5 percent, at $57.20 while Halliburton Co., the world's biggest oilfield 
services company, was down $1.61, or over 4 percent, at $37.18.

STOCKWATCH Enron lower amid market deterioration after reaffirming guidance

03/22/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were lower in late morning trade, 
falling 7.4 pct, pressured by the general share market deterioration as the 
company's reaffirmation of its earnings guidance failed to boost the stock, 
dealers said. 
At 11.37 am, the stock was down 4.14 usd at 51.75, as the DJIA traded down 
318.9 points at 9,168.09, and the Nasdaq composite down 31.78 at 1,798.45.
Dealers attributed the stock's failure to rally, despite its positive 
earnings news, to the market's rapid deterioration this week, noting 
extremely negative market breadth. 
On the NYSE, only 471 stocks were higher, 2,693 lower, and 195 stocks 
unchanged. 
Earlier today Enron reiterated its guidance that it expects its 2001 earnings 
per share to be 1.70-1.75 usd. The Thomson Financial/First Call 2001 EPS 
estimate for Enron is for 1.74 usd. 
Despite Enron's price declines yesterday and today, Salomon Smith Barney 
energy and commodities pricing analyst Raymond Niles said the falls were not 
justified by company fundamentals or recent concerns over its bandwidth unit. 
""Specifically, we are not at all concerned about non-commercial bank office 
deployments of personnel with the bandwidth group."" 
""We remain confident that bandwidth trading, the key segment within Enron's 
bandwidth strategy, will show strong growth in the first quarter.""

Energy Researcher Says California Not Fixing Power Problems

Energy Researcher Says California Not Fixing Power Problems

     (For more stories on the California energy crisis, see
{EXTR <GO>}.)

     Washington, March 22 (Bloomberg) -- The director of energy
consultant Cambridge Energy Research Associates told the U.S.
Congress that California's actions to address its energy crisis
won't increase power supplies and could harm the state's finances.
     California should accelerate power-plant construction to add
supply and remove consumer-rate controls to damp electricity
demand, Lawrence Makovich, Cambridge Energy's senior director, said
in printed testimony for the U.S. House of Representatives
subcommittee on energy and air quality. The state also should avoid
signing long-term supply contracts with high fixed prices, he said.
     California has spent more than $3.2 billion this year buying
electricity for its nearly insolvent investor-owned utilities,
which have been forced to buy power on the open market for more
than they can charge consumers under a 1996 state deregulation law.
With demand heavy and affordable wholesale power scarce, California
has endured rolling blackouts this week and in January.
     ``If this crisis drives California back to the heavy-handed
regulation that launched deregulation in the first place, or to an
expansive public power authority, then the state is likely to find
its electric sector becoming increasingly inefficient and
expensive,'' Makovich's testimony said.
     The state is attempting to buy the transmission lines of
California's three largest utilities, PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas &
Electric, Edison International's Southern California Edison and
Sempra Energy's San Diego Gas & Electric, to provide the utilities
with funds.
     The state faces years of high energy payments by signing long-
term energy contracts with companies such as Calpine Corp., Enron
Corp., and Duke Energy Corp. during a shortage, Makovich said.
California could discourage investment needed to build new power
plants by an attempt to gain ownership of much of California's
electricity grid, he added.
     California has an energy shortage because no significant power
plants were built in the state in the last decade, even as demand
skyrocketed. Drier-than-normal weather has also reduced electricity
supplies from hydroelectric plants in the northwestern U.S.

Enron Reaffirms 2001 Forecast After Stock Price Falls (Update1)

Enron Reaffirms 2001 Forecast After Stock Price Falls (Update1)

     (Updates percentage decline in first paragraph and closes
shares.)

     Houston, March 22 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., whose shares
have fallen 17 percent in the past week on concern the company's
telecommunications business won't generate the expected profit,
said it still expects to earn $1.70 to $1.75 a share this year.
     The largest energy trader raised its 2001 profit estimate in
January, citing growth in European and North American trading and
more business from its fiber-optic network. It previously forecast
profit of $1.60 to $1.70 a share.
     Enron's shares fell 11 percent on March 12 after the collapse
of an agreement for Blockbuster Inc. to deliver movies on demand
over Enron's fiber-optic system. The shares continued to fall this
week, partly on speculation Enron may exit the broadband business,
Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Curt Launer said in a report.
     ``The market is panicked to a certain extent,'' said Dain
Rauscher Wessels analyst Mark Easterbrook, who has a ``strong
buy'' rating on Enron shares.
     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell 87 cents to $55.02 after
touching a 52-week low of $51.51 earlier.
     ``Broadband is a core business of Enron's,'' spokesman Vance
Meyer said. ``All of our businesses are doing very well, and we
plan to hit our earnings targets, and that includes broadband.''
     Investors also are concerned that falling natural-gas prices
and California's energy crisis may hurt Enron's trading business,
analysts said. Enron also has failed to get the Indian government-
owned Maharashtra State Electricity Board to pay its December
power bill.
     Easterbrook said he expects the shares to rebound once Enron
reports first-quarter earnings on April 17.
     ``The stock may act weak here, it may continue to act weak
for the next several days,'' he said. ``But I think first-quarter
earnings will be a pretty good catalyst.''
     The company is expected to earn 44 cents a share in the first
quarter, the average estimate of analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial. It earned $338 million, or 40 cents, a
year earlier.

(Enron has scheduled a conference call for tomorrow at 1 p.m. New
York time ``to provide investors with a general update on the
company,'' it said. A live Webcast of the call will be available
through the Investors section of http://www.enron.com.)

Enron Corp.'s India Unit Faces $88.2 Mln Penalty, Paper Says
2001-03-22 23:04 (New York)


     New Delhi, March 23 (Bloomberg) -- Dabhol Power Co., Enron
Corp.'s India unit, has been asked by Maharashtra state to pay a
fine of 4.12 billion rupees ($88.2 million) for not generating at
full capacity within three hours of being asked to do so, the
Economic Times reported, without citing sources.
     The move is part of a tussle between the two sides over dues.
Earlier this month, Dabhol said it had asked the federal
government to pay a 1.02 million-rupee power bill run up by the
Maharashtra State Electricity Board, or MSEB, for December.
     The government of Maharashtra, the western Indian state where
Dabhol is located, last month had to pay $17 million as its
November dues after the company invoked a federal government
guarantee.
     The Maharashtra government asked the federal government not
to pay the bill for December and instead offset it against the
penalty, the report said.
     Dabhol didn't respond to requests in time in the last three
months of 2000, the paper reported. The federal government is
expected to decide on the issue in a day or two, the paper said.

03/23/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, March 23 (Reuters) - Enron Corp.'s broadband unit will execute 
nearly twice as many trades in the first quarter of 2001 as it did in the 
fourth quarter of 2000, Enron President and Chief Executive Officer Jeff 
Skilling said on Friday. 
""My expectation is that we will see over 400, maybe over 500 transactions 
this quarter which shows this business is absolutely developing, it is ahead 
of plans,"" Skilling said in a conference call that sought to assuage investor 
fears about Enron's stock and its broadband unit specifically.
That is more than all 321 transactions done last year, and about twice the 
236 done in the last quarter of 2000, he said. 
Skilling also said long supply and a weak telecom market is offering Enron 
greater and cheaper access to bandwidth capacity, which means Enron Broadband 
Services' capital expenditure budget should drop from $750 million to $250 
million. 
Some analysts have attributed two consecutive days of price drops in Enron's 
stock - it dipped as low as $51.55 on Thursday, from 60.95 on Tuesday - to 
false rumors of layoffs at the nascent broadband business and the market's 
devaluation of that unit in light of weak technology and telecom sectors.

Enron Says $3.1 Bln Portland General Sale Probably Won't Close

     Houston, March 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, said its $3.1 billion sale of Portland General
Electric Co. to Sierra Pacific Resources probably won't be
completed.
     ``There's probably a 5 percent probability that Sierra
Pacific's purchase of Portland General will be consummated,''
Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling said during a conference call
with investors.
     Enron said in January that Sierra Pacific might not be able
to sell a Nevada power-plant stake as needed to win regulatory
approval for the Portland General transaction. Enron blamed a
California law that barred public utilities from shedding
generators until 2005 because of an electricity shortage.
     Shares of Houston-based Enron rose $3.98 to $59 in
midafternoon trading. They had fallen 18 percent in the past week.

HOUSTON (AP) - Shares of Enron Corp. surged nearly 8 percent Friday as chief

USA: UPDATE 1-Enron seeks to assuage investor fears of broadband.
By C. Bryson Hull

03/23/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, March 23 (Reuters) - Enron Corp.'s top executive set out on Friday 
to assuage investor fears about trouble in the company's broadband unit, 
assuring Wall Street that the nascent business was on track to meet its 
targets. 
Enron president and chief executive Jeff Skilling told analysts on a 
conference call that the broadband unit, which has been the subject of false 
layoff rumors, is in good shape and would actually benefit from the current 
weak market for bandwidth capacity.
""My expectation is that we will see over 400, maybe over 500 transactions 
this quarter, which shows this business is absolutely developing. It is ahead 
of plans,"" Skilling said. 
If expectations are met, Enron will have cut roughly twice as many deals for 
the first quarter of 2001 as it did in the fourth quarter of 2000, when it 
performed 236 transactions, Skilling said. In all of 2000, Enron cut 321 
broadband deals, he said. 
Enron has said it expects a sevenfold increase in bandwidth transactions in 
2001 compared with last year. 
The conference call followed two hard days for Enron's stock which lost about 
8 percent of its value and dropped under $59 for the first time since January 
2000. 
Investors, already pushing the stock price up before Skilling's midday call, 
reacted favorably to his comments on Friday as shares closed at $59.40, up 
$4.31 - nearly eight percent higher. 
""It seems to me that there have been a lot of little negatives developments 
along the way and these have taken their toll on the stock, in fact I think 
the stock has clearly overreacted,"" UBS Warburg analyst Ron Barone said. 
LONG BANDWIDTH SUPPLY A BONUS - 
A long supply of bandwidth capacity and a weak telecom market translates to a 
savings of about $500 million in capital costs Enron laid out to develop its 
bandwidth network this year, Skilling said. 
""We will not have to make as ... large an investment in our network as we had 
expected because we are going to have access to third-party networks much 
more easily than we could have possibly expected,"" he said. 
""There is a huge amount of capacity out there and people are desperate to 
sell capacity for cash,"" Skilling said. 
That should translate to a $500 million drop in Enron Broadband Services' 
(EBS) 2001 capital budget of $750 million. 
Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade said growing liquidity and access 
is a good sign for Enron's bandwidth trading business. 
""If prices fall, Enron is largely agnostic because there is just a big a need 
to optimize the price of fiber transport when prices are falling as when 
prices are rising,"" Meade said. 
Meade said he was not certain whether some of the shrinking capital outlay 
might be related to Enron's broadband content business, which suffered a blow 
three weeks ago with the collapse of its 20-year-exclusive video on demand 
deal with Blockbuster Inc.. 
BROADBAND RUMORS FUELED STOCK DROP 
Some analysts have attributed two consecutive days of price drops in Enron's 
stock to false rumors of layoffs at EBS and the market's devaluation of that 
unit in light of weakness in the technology and telecom sectors. 
Skilling reiterated earlier denials of layoff talk, which Enron says was 
prompted by a shift of personnel inside EBS. 
""Enron had a very specific purpose on the conference call which was to dispel 
rumors about their bandwidth unit and they said they are not true,"" Salomon 
Smith Barney analyst Ray Niles said. 
Niles said the broadband numbers Skilling gave look in line with reaching the 
target of a sevenfold increase, which ""would fully validate the potential of 
the market,"" Niles said. 
Skilling addressed lingering concerns over payment problems at its Dabhol 
power plant, the California power crisis and reaffirmed Enron's projected 
earnings per share of $1.70-$1.75 in 2001. 
""Our credit exposure in California has actually dropped, so regardless of 
what happens in California the $1.70-1.75 numbers I think look great,"" 
Skilling said. 
On Dabhol, Skilling reiterated his view that India's national government 
would continue to honor its contract to back power payments if the 
Maharashtra state government did not.

Cinergy Capital & Trading Completes Acquisition of Merchant
2001-03-23 15:27 (New York)

 Generating Plants From Enron

   Business Editors, Energy Writers

   CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 23, 2001--Cinergy Capital &
Trading, Inc., an energy merchant-focused affiliate of Cinergy Corp.
(NYSE:CIN), announced today that it has completed the acquisition of
two merchant generating facilities in the Southeast U.S. from Enron
North America.
   The two companies announced in December, 2000, that they had
signed a definitive agreement subject to regulatory approvals, which
have now been received. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
   ""This purchase of 1,000 megawatts of natural gas-fired capacity is
another key milestone for the asset development segment of our energy
merchant business. It will directly contribute to our target of
growing our energy merchant earnings at a 10-12 percent average rate
as part of our three-year corporate target of seven to eight percent,""
said Michael J. Cyrus, CEO of Cinergy's energy merchant business unit
and president of Capital & Trading. ""It also gives our business
merchant capability in another energy trading hub that will complement
our leadership status in the 'Into Cinergy' energy trading hub.""
   The acquisition consists of Enron's 494-megawatt Brownsville
generation facility located in Haywood County, Tennessee and the
504-megawatt Caledonia generation facility located in Lowndes County,
Mississippi. Brownsville has four natural gas-fired combustion
turbines and Caledonia has six. Plant management and staff at both
facilities have agreed to join Cinergy, allowing these facilities to
be ready for the summer peaking season.
   Cinergy Corp., one of the nation's leading diversified energy
companies, has a focused strategy intent on growing its energy
merchant business. The company owns, operates or has under development
over 21,000 megawatts of generation. Cinergy has the 6th largest
electricity trading organization in the U.S. as well as physical and
financial gas trading capabilities of 17 bcf/day. The ""Into Cinergy""
power trading hub is the most liquid trading hub in the United States.
Cinergy's energy merchant business operates in several regions of the
U.S. and is based on a profitable balance of asset development,
customer origination, marketing and trading, industrial-site
cogeneration infrastructure development and plant operations.
   Cinergy also owns regulated operations in Ohio, Indiana and
Kentucky that serve about 1.5 million electric customers and about
500,000 gas customers. In addition, Cinergy manages one of the
industry's top power technology portfolios.

Enron Says Portland General Sale Probably Won't Close (Update2)

Enron Says Portland General Sale Probably Won't Close (Update2)

     (Adds information on share movement, analyst comment. Closes
shares. For more on the California electricity crisis, see {EXTRA
<GO>}.)

     Houston, March 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, said its $3.1 billion sale of Portland General
Electric Co. to Sierra Pacific Resources probably won't be
completed because of California's energy crisis.
     ``There's probably a 5 percent probability that Sierra
Pacific's purchase of Portland General will be consummated,''
Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling said on a conference call with
investors.
     In January, Enron said Sierra Pacific might not be able to
sell a 14 percent stake in the Mohave coal-fired power plant in
Nevada as needed to win regulatory approval of the purchase of
Portland General.
     AES Corp. planned to buy the Mohave stake, along with a 56
percent stake owned by Southern California Edison, for $667
million. Southern California Edison, owned by Edison
International, can't sell its stake because California has banned
the sale of generators by its utilities until 2006 because of an
electricity shortage.

                         Committed to Bandwidth

     Skilling also said that while Houston-based Enron is cutting
spending on its fiber-optic telecommunciations business, the
company doesn't intend to sell it. The news sent Enron shares up
$4.38, or 8 percent, to $59.40. They had fallen 25 percent since
Friday on concerns about the fiber-optic business and disputes
over an Enron power plant in India.
     ``They assured Wall Street that they were not liquidating
their bandwith trading business,'' Prudential Securities analyst
Carol Coale said. Analysts have reckoned that the potential of
bandwidth trading adds as much as $20 to the future value of
Enron's stock, she said.
     Skilling did confirm speculation that Enron is cutting
capital spending and cutting bandwidth staff, although the
employees won't necessarily be fired from the company.
     Portland General is making money, and Enron still is willing
to sell the Oregon utility, Skilling said.
     Sierra Pacific has not given up on its plans to buy Portland
General, said Sierra Pacific Resources spokeswoman Faye Andersen.
Five percent ``is a figure of speech,'' she said. ``We know it
will be difficult, but we will meet our obligations.''
     Enron's share-price fell to as low as $51.51 yesterday, a
drop that was ``just crazy,'' Skilling said on the conference
call, which was scheduled to reassure investors worried about
Enron's plunging share price.
     The shares had fallen 29 percent this year on concern that
its businesses in broadband and in California and India might lose
money or might not make as much as expected.
     Enron's shares fell 11 percent on March 12 after the collapse
of an agreement for Blockbuster Inc. to deliver movies on demand
over Enron's fiber-optic system.


                            Strong Profit

     The company said yesterday it still expects profit of $1.70
to $1.75 a share this year. Enron raised its 2001 profit estimate
in January, citing growth in European and North American trading
and more business from its fiber-optic network. It previously
expected to earn $1.60 to $1.70 a share.
     The company is expected to earn 45 cents a share in the first
quarter, the average estimate of analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial. Estimates range from 43 cents to 47 cents.
Enron earned $338 million, or 40 cents, a year earlier.
     Enron's credit exposure in California has ``actually
dropped'' in the past few months, Skilling said. ``We have more
than ample reserves.''
     Enron isn't a power generator in California, though it trades
with power and gas companies in the state that may default.
California's two largest utilities are on the brink of bankruptcy
partly because they've been paying more for power than they're
allowed to charge consumers.

                           Cost Savings

     Enron expects to save about $500 million in costs previously
set for building its broadband network, said Mark Koenig,
executive vice president for investor relations. That reduces the
company's planned capital spending, as outlined in U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission filings, to $1 billion in 2001 from about
$1.5 billion.
     For the broadband unit, it reduces planned spending to as
little as $250 million from a planned $750 million, Enron
spokesman Mark Palmer said.
     ``We will not have to make as large an investment in our
network as we expected because we'll have access to other
networks,'' Skilling said.
     Enron remains committed to the video-on-demand business and
expects to sign contracts with video-providers in the next few
months, Skilling said.

Viacom Drops Blockbuster Split-Off Plan --- Rebound in Video Business 
Produces an About-face In Strategy for the Unit
By Martin Peers
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

03/28/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A3
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- Viacom Inc. is finally giving up on its long-stalled plan to 
split off its Blockbuster Inc. unit, saying that the video-rental giant's 
business has turned around so well in the past few years that it wants to 
keep it. 
For more than a year Viacom has said it was waiting for a recovery in 
Blockbuster's stock -- long stalled below its offering price -- before it 
went ahead with previously announced plans to split off the remaining 82.3% 
of the publicly traded unit. But Viacom now has ""no plans"" to do the 
split-off, Viacom President Mel Karmazin said in an interview. Mr. Karmazin 
said the change in Viacom's attitude largely reflects a significant 
turnaround in Blockbuster's core video-rental business.
""Blockbuster has been picking up market share and growing the business,"" Mr. 
Karmazin said, adding that Viacom was ""very enthusiastic about its future 
prospects."" 
Viacom will formalize its new stance in its 10-K annual report, expected to 
be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next couple of 
days. 
Viacom's change of mind is likely to spark speculation that the company will 
make an offer to buy the 17.7% of Blockbuster stock outstanding that is in 
the public's hands, to make it easier to tap the cash now being generated by 
the chain. Mr. Karmazin declined to comment on that yesterday. 
It is the latest twist in Viacom's long saga with Blockbuster. When Viacom 
originally acquired the business in 1994, it hoped it would be a cash cow 
that would help pay for the Paramount Communications acquisition that year. 
But instead, Blockbuster turned into a problem child, as growth in the video 
market ground to a near halt and the unit spent most of its cash on building 
new stores. By 1997, it was a drag on Viacom's stock. 
But the situation has turned around. Blockbuster's video-rental business is 
growing strongly while many of Viacom's advertising-dependent businesses, 
especially television and radio, are likely to be affected by the weakening 
economy. Blockbuster has been able to grab market share, reflecting fading 
competition from other chains and independent stores. It also has scaled back 
its store-building plan, so it is generating cash. 
Although Viacom started talking about creating a separate stock for 
Blockbuster in 1997, it wasn't until August 1999 that Viacom sold a minority 
stake in an initial public offering. At the time Viacom planned to unload 
within about a year of the IPO its remaining Blockbuster holding by offering 
Viacom shareholders a chance to exchange their shares for stock in the 
video-rental unit. 
But the IPO didn't do as well as expected. With new technologies on the 
horizon such as video-on-demand, Blockbuster was seen as vulnerable, and 
investors weren't attracted to the stock. Within months of the offering, 
Blockbuster stock was trading below the $15-a-share offering price, which 
damped Viacom's enthusiasm for proceeding with the rest of the split-off. By 
the end of 1999, Viacom said it wouldn't proceed with the split-off unless 
Blockbuster's stock price rose above $20. 
Blockbuster's stock remains considerably below the $20 mark, meaning that the 
unit might not have been fully split off in the near term anyway. And Viacom 
could always change its mind if conditions shift again. But for now, 
Blockbuster appears to be solidly part of the Viacom family. 
Blockbuster stock rallied sharply in the first couple of months of this year, 
from around $8 at the end of last year to a high of $15.10 in late February. 
Its shares rose six cents to $13.30 as of 4 p.m. yesterday in New York Stock 
Exchange composite trading. Salomon Smith Barney analyst David Riedel said 
the rally reflected Blockbuster's performance and expectations that it will 
report a ""phenomenal"" first quarter. 
Mr. Riedel said he expects Blockbuster to report EBITDA of $582 million this 
year, including losses on new media, on revenue of $5.36 billion. Last year 
the unit generated EBITDA of $534.8 million on revenue of $4.96 billion. By 
comparison, in 1997 Blockbuster had EBITDA of $207.9 million on revenue of 
$3.3 billion. EBITDA, often referred to loosely as operating cash flow, is 
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. 
John Antioco, who took over as chief executive of Blockbuster in mid-1997 and 
is credited with overseeing the comeback, said Blockbuster's U.S. market 
share has risen to 36% at the end of last year from 26% in 1997. He said the 
company expects Blockbuster's share to approach 40% by the end of this year 
and to rise to 50% over the next three years. 
Meanwhile, the specter that new electronic services would hurt Blockbuster 
has faded. Blockbuster's own efforts to roll out a video-on-demand service 
with energy concern Enron Corp. were recently terminated, although 
Blockbuster says it continues to experiment with VOD. 
Business is so strong that Blockbuster now is having to deal with a new 
problem: long check-out lines at stores, where in some cases customers have 
had to wait for 45 minutes. Mr. Antioco said Blockbuster was working to 
relieve capacity problems, noting that the amount of business in the average 
Blockbuster store has grown 35% in the past three years.

Bush Names 2 to Panel Monitoring Energy Markets
By JOSEPH KAHN

03/28/2001
The New York Times
Page 14, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, March 27 -- President Bush named two new commissioners today to 
the federal agency that oversees electricity markets, a move that could lead 
to a shift in the agency's largely hands-off approach to California's power 
crisis. 
Mr. Bush named Patrick H. Wood III, head of the Texas Public Utility 
Commission and a longtime ally of the president, to fill a vacant seat on the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The president also named Nora M. 
Brownell, who serves on the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission, to fill 
a second open slot on the commission.
Both appointees, who face confirmation by the Senate, are Republicans who 
support free markets for natural gas and electricity. But Mr. Wood has said 
he believes that the agency needs to do more to ensure well-functioning 
energy markets in California and other places or risk seeing deregulation 
fail entirely. 
''On our best day as regulators, we cannot deliver benefits to customers as 
well as a functional market can,'' Mr. Wood said in a statement today, ''but 
the market must work right first.'' 
Mr. Wood, who has overseen the restructuring of the electricity industry in 
Texas, supported the imposition of a price cap of $1,000 per megawatt-hour 
for wholesale electricity sales there. The measure was designed to ensure 
that prices did not spiral out of control in periods of high demand or low 
capacity, as they have in California. At times in the last year, wholesale 
electricity in California has sold for thousands of dollars per 
megawatt-hour. 
Mr. Wood also supervised deregulation of telecommunications in Texas, an 
effort that earned him a reputation for working to ensure a competitive 
market. 
Curt Hebert Jr., a fellow Republican who is the federal commission's 
chairman, has consistently opposed price caps. Mr. Hebert has contended that 
high prices in California reflect supply and demand, not price gouging by 
power companies, though he has recently supported his agency's policy to 
curtail the highest prices charged during hours of the most acute electricity 
shortages. 
Many Congressional officials and energy industry lobbyists said they expected 
Mr. Bush to name Mr. Wood to replace Mr. Hebert as chairman in the coming 
weeks. But his administration took no action on that front today. 
''At this time, the makeup and leadership of the commission will stay as it 
is,'' said Anne Womack, a White House spokeswoman. 
The question of who will lead the agency has led to a political tug-of-war 
between the president and the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, several 
Congressional and industry officials said. Mr. Lott has strongly backed Mr. 
Hebert, who like the majority leader is from Mississippi. 
Mr. Hebert issued a statement welcoming the new commissioners. His spokesman 
declined to comment on whether Mr. Hebert expected to stay on as chairman, 
calling it speculation. 
The appointments come as the low-profile agency has come under heavy pressure 
to intervene in California, where wholesale electricity prices have risen 
more than tenfold in the last year. 
The agency has the mandate to ensure ''just and reasonable'' electricity 
prices. But it has wielded its regulatory club with great reluctance, in part 
because Mr. Hebert has opposed intervention in the marketplace. 
The agency staff has often decided against investigating power generating 
companies, though state regulators in California and elsewhere have charged 
that companies routinely manipulate experimental auction markets for 
electricity. 
The agency took its first substantial enforcement action in California 
earlier this month, asking generators to justify some of their prices or pay 
refunds that could total $124 million for January and February. But one of 
the three sitting commissioners and many outside analysts criticized that 
action as arbitrary and limited in scope. 
Some critics of the agency expressed optimism that Mr. Wood would bring a 
fresh perspective. 
''Pat Wood has an entirely different approach than Hebert,'' says Mark Cooper 
of the Consumer Federation of America, a watchdog group. ''He's committed to 
markets, but he is willing to do things to make sure the markets work. He not 
just an ideologue.'' 
He was less supportive of Ms. Brownell, who he said has been ''unwilling to 
recognize'' problems in a Pennsylvania electricity restructuring program that 
has led to higher prices there. 
Energy industry officials said they supported both new appointments. Joseph 
Hartsoe, vice president for federal regulatory affairs at the Enron 
Corporation, said that under Mr. Wood, Texas did a better job of 
restructuring its electricity markets than California has. 
He said Mr. Wood's ties to Mr. Bush could give him the credibility to push 
through changes to energy markets around the country.

Enron pays Lay $7 million bonus for 'strong' year 
Reuters News Service 
WASHINGTON -- Electricity and natural gas marketing company Enron Corp., 
coming offan ""extremely strong"" 2000, rewarded Chairman Kenneth Lay with a 79 
percent boost to his bonus, Enron said Tuesday. 
Lay's 2000 bonus shot up to $7 million from $3.9 million in 1999, the 
Houston-based company said in its annual proxy statement filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
""In recognition of Enron's extremely strong performance during 2000 relative 
to recurring after-tax net income and other financial measures, Mr. Lay 
received a cash annual incentive award of $7,000,000,"" the company said. 
Lay's base salary last year was $1.3 million, unchanged from 1999. 
He also received $7.5 million in restricted stock awards as well as options 
for 782,830 shares that could be valued at $35 million if Enron's stock 
appreciated 10 percent annually. 





JAPAN: Enron presents power plant plan to Japan govt.

03/28/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

TOKYO, March 28 (Reuters) - U.S.-based Enron Corp on Wednesday presented 
plans to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) fired power plant in northern 
Japan, aiming to become the first foreign company to build such a plant in 
Japan. 
The move brings Enron one step closer to realising its plan to build a power 
plant with an initial capacity of two million kilowatts in Aomori prefecture.
""We submitted our basic plan to build the plant to the governor of Aomori 
prefecture today in line with last November's announcement,"" Tatsuro Seguchi, 
president of Enron Corp's Japanese affiliate Encom Corp, told a news 
conference. 
""We are aiming to start construction of the plant in 2004 and start 
operations by 2007 since Japan's power market is one of our highest 
priorities,"" he said. 
The company still needs to clear several hurdles, including an environmental 
assessment. 
In November last year, Encom announced it would spend about 20 billion yen 
($163.8 million) on the new plant. 
Seguchi said, however, that the cost of purchasing land and building 
LNG-related facilities was adding up to more than initial estimates. 
He said the company now expected to spend far more than 20 billion yen and 
possibly over 100 billion yen, but he declined to provide specific figures. 
Seguchi said a plant with an initial capacity of two million kilowatts would 
require the equivalent of two million tonnes of LNG per year. 
The plant, to be built by E Power Corp - a wholly-owned unit of Encom - could 
eventually expand capacity to 3-4 million kilowatts if there is enough 
demand. 
North America's leading buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas set 
up Encom Corp in 1999 with leading Japanese firm Orix Corp to look into 
entering the market. 
Since March last year, non-utility firms have been allowed to sell 
electricity to large-lot industrial users, opening up the cozy industry to 
newcomers. 
Several foreign firms, including U.S. oil major Texaco Inc , and the 
Royal/Dutch Shell Group have also said they are keen to gain a foothold.

Enron's Japan Venture Submits Pwr Proj Plan To Local Govt

03/28/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

TOKYO -(Dow Jones)- EnCom Corp. (Japan), a New-York based power venture set 
up by Enron Corp. (ENE) of the U.S. and Orix Corp. (IX), said it submitted a 
basic plan for a large-scale thermal power project in northern Japan to the 
local government of Aomori Prefecture Wednesday. 
According to the plan, EnCom plans to build a gas-turbine combined cycle 
power plant with an initial capacity of 2,000 megawatts in the Mutsu Ogawara 
industrial area in Aomori in the northern part of Japan's main island.
The company also plans to build a liquefied natural gas terminal, including a 
sea berth capable of accommodating 135,000-cubic-meter tankers and LNG 
storage tanks. 
Construction is scheduled to begin in 2004, following an environmental 
assessment and approval from relevant authorities, for commercial operation 
in 2007 or later. 
""We have completed a preliminary study (on the project) that started in 
December,"" said Tatsuro Seguchi, president of EnCom's Tokyo-based 
wholly-owned subsidiary, E Power Corp. Seguchi, who was speaking to 
reporters, declined to estimate the total cost of the project, which industry 
observers say would cost a few hundred billion yen. 
The Aomori government reiterated that it welcomes the move by EnCom. 
""Building a large power plant that is relatively environmentally-friendly in 
the Mutsu Ogawara area would contribute to the economy and employment in the 
prefecture,"" Governor Morio Kimura said. 
The proposed project would also help lure enterprises of various kinds to set 
up operations in the area, Kimura said in a statement. 
However, industry sources say there is a large hurdle for EnCom to clear - 
how to secure a massive capacity for power transmission to supply electricity 
to customers. 
Seguchi said EnCom has made a request to Tohoku Electric Power Co. (J.THE or 
9506), a regional power utility serving northern Japan, for leasing its 
transmission lines. EnCom is waiting for a reply from Tohoku, he said. 
EnCom is considering other sites in Japan on which it may build large-scale 
power plants. Candidate sites include Ube in Yamaguchi prefecture, western 
Japan, and Fukuoka Prefecture on the southwestern island of Kyushu. - - 
28/03/01 10-39G 

Up until now, E Power hasn't entered Japan's partially deregulated retail 
power market, Seguchi said. 
Since Japan opened the retail power market for large-lot high-volume 
industrial and commercial users - which represent roughly 30% of total power 
demand - to free competition in March 2000, a number of new entrants have 
been tapping into the country's Y15 trillion industry. 
Seguchi said that other than building its own power stations, E Power is also 
in talks with factories to purchase their excess electricity or revamp their 
aging small generators for resale of the power. Retail power sales via Enron 
Japan Corp., a wholly-owned unit of the Houston-based Enron, is possible, he 
added. 
In August 1999, the U.S. energy and communications giant Enron and Orix 
formed EnCom, in which Enron owns more than 60%, then set up E Power in a bid 
to get a foothold in Japan's power industry.

DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- Dubai is ""desperate"" for natural gas supplies for power 
generation and industrial use, Hussain Sultan, group chief executive of the 
Emirates National Oil Co., said Wednesday. 
Hussain, speaking at an oil and gas conference, said it is ""costing a 
fortune"" for Dubai, the United Arab Emirates' second-largest emirate, to run 
its 20,000-megawatt power station with liquid fuels.
Dubai's industrial free port at Jebel Ali and the Dubai Aluminium Co. Ltd., 
which expanded its annual capacity last year to 536,000 metric tons, are in 
extremely short supply of gas, said local observers. 
Hussain said the recently signed ""term sheet agreement"" between the U.A.E. 
Offsets Group, or UOG, and Qatar Petroleum, to supply 2 billion cubic feet of 
gas a day to Abu Dhabi and Dubai, is a step in the right direction. 
Three weeks ago, QP and UOG signed a $3.5 billion agreement to export 2 bcf a 
day of Qatari natural gas to the U.A.E. 
The project, which will be undertaken by Dolphin Energy Ltd. - in which 
TotalFinaElf (TOT) and Enron Corp. (ENE) each hold a 24.5% stake - plans to 
drill first wells at Qatar's giant offshore North Field in the second half of 
2001 and come onstream in early 2005. 
About 1-1.5 bcf a day of the gas will be consumed by the al-Taweelah power 
plant in Abu Dhabi and the remainder by the Jebel Ali terminal. 
Sources told Dow Jones Newswires Wednesday that Abu Dhabi is considering 
subsidizing the gas supplied to Dubai by Dolphin. However, comprehensive 
pricing and other details of the whole project aren't expected to be 
finalized for another few weeks.

India: Centre may bar States' direct access to funds

03/28/2001

Asia Intelligence Wire

NEW DELHI, March 27. THE Centre is planning to prevent access to funds from 
multilateral agencies by State Governments whose financial positions are 
precarious. 
Further, States will not be allowed to directly negotiate on their own 
sectoral loans with the World Bank or any other multilateral institution.
The move is being considered in view of the sudden deterioration in the 
finances of several States, including those with a reputation for fiscal 
discipline. 
Officials here cite the case of Kerala, which is in line for assistance from 
the Asian Development Bank (ADB) under the Public Resource Management 
Programme. This is a State which has a reasonably sound record at additional 
resources mobilisation, but is now facing an unprecedented resource crunch. 
Indeed, so acute is the current situation that the State Treasury is only 
able to pay salaries to Government employees. There have also been instances 
of cheques issued by the State Government bouncing. 
Similar is the case of Maharashtra, which till a couple of years ago, was 
considered the role model for fiscal rectitude, but whose finances have taken 
a severe beating of late, with the Enron payment crisis only accentuating the 
situation. ""If we have reached a situation where even so-called 
well-performing States are on the brink of financial emergency, allowing them 
to negotiate loans from multilateral funding agencies on their own is simply 
not prudent,"" the officials added. 
States which intend accessing sectoral loans will now have to route their 
proposals through a high-level committee constituted recently to monitor the 
States Fiscal Reform Facility. 
The panel, comprising representatives from the Finance Ministry, Planning 
Commission, Reserve Bank of India and State Governments, will essentially be 
the 'one-stop shop' for clearing such proposals. Finance Ministry officials 
said this was being done to avoid the burden of the repayment of the loans 
from falling upon the Central Government, which provides guarantee for 
funding from the World Bank and the ADB. 
Under the present dispensation, multilateral loans are first routed to the 
Centre which, in turn, on-lends them to States. State Governments in effect 
cannot access such loans directly. 
""However, the practice of allowing States to negotiate directly with funding 
agencies often leaves the Centre with no option but to approve such loans as 
it virtually becomes a fait accompli,"" said officials. 
They said the Centre had already sounded out the World Bank and other 
multilateral agencies on its decision to debar States from entering into 
direct negotiations. 
Earlier, the Finance Ministry was also planning to harmonise core reform 
milestones set out for States by various funding agencies to ensure 
monitoring authorities did not work at cross purposes. 
Based on the recommendations of the EFC, the Finance Ministry recently 
outlined the broad action points for fiscal correction in States encompassing 
reforms in the power sector, public sector and budgetary reforms. 
States have been given the flexibility to draw up their own medium term 
fiscal restructuring policy (MTFRP) based on these action points. 
Officials said the Centre now decided to shelve the exercise of harmonisation 
of reform milestones with the World Bank and other funding agencies as it 
apprehended that such a move could have political ramifications.

Enron and PowerGen, global power majors, have decided to withdraw their bids 
for picking up a 26 per cent stake in the 500 mw Vijayanagar Thermal Power 
Project (VTPP). 
Following their withdrawal, KPCL has initiated talks with domestic power 
equipment giant Larsen & Toubro (L&T) to pick up the stake.
VTPP is promoted by Karnataka Power Corporation (KPCL), the generation arm of 
the Karnataka government. 
An Enron spokesperson said, ""In India, Enron will not make any further 
investment till the power sector becomes economically viable"". A PowerGen 
spokesman said, ""We did not submit the bid."" 
However, PowerGen sources said that the company is pre-qualified but decided 
against bidding. The move is in line with the company's decision to get out 
of India. 
Senior officials with L&T said, ""We have initiated talks with KPCL for 
picking up a controlling stake in VTPP. Talks are in an advanced stage and an 
agreement will be concluded within a month."" 
L&T does not operate any power project in the country, and is the 
engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractor for many power 
projects in the country. 
The cost VTPP is estimated at Rs 2,100 crore with a 75:25 debt-equity ratio. 
KPCL is planning to hold a 26 per cent stake in the project. The balance will 
be held by the public and financial institutions. If the ongoing talks 
materialise, L&T as well as KPCL will have to bring in Rs 136.5 crore each as 
equity. 
Sources with financial institutions said that if L&T is finalised as the 
joint venture partner, it may also be the engineering, procurement, 
construction contractor. This might result in L&T picking up a higher stake.

Enron, the US-based multinational energy and communications major and the 
promoter of the naphtha-based Dabhol power project, is making a foray into 
wind power in India. 
Enron Wind, a group company, has applied to the government seeking approval 
to set up a wholly owned subsidiary for assembling, installation, operation 
and maintenance of wind turbines and development of wind farms, said sources.
The company has proposed to make an initial investment of $2 million in the 
new subsidiary which will be increased subsequently. The proposal will be 
considered by the foreign investment promotion board tomorrow, and the 
administrative ministry the ministry of non-conventional energy sources has 
given its consent, the sources said. 
Wind power is not a popular mode of energy generation in the country, and 
previous attempts by private players have not been successful. Enron's 
initiative in the field will be watched with interest, a government official 
said. 
The company has an installed wind power generator adjacent to its Dabhol 
project in Maharashtra which has been continuously gauging the nature of wind 
and the possibilities of using wind as a perennial source of power in the 
country. 
According to the company's official website, the western coast of the country 
has been identified as a possible area of proposed projects. However, the 
site map does not have any information on the exact location of the project. 
On earlier occasions, companies have tried wind power generation in Tamil 
Nadu. The investment in the proposed Indian subsidiary will be made by Enron 
Wind GmbH, Germany. The arm will be based in Mumbai, where Enron's main 
subsidiary is headquartered. 
Enron Wind is one of the largest players in the modern wind power industry. 
Over the last few decades, the company has designed and constructed wind 
power facilities around the world comprising more than 4,500 wind turbines 
and 1,600 mega watts of capacity. 
Enron Wind offers wind turbine technology, skilled project development, 
creative financing options, accomplished power plant design and engineering, 
and experienced and responsive support services.

Big Rate Hikes

* The Public Utilities Commission's reasons for the rate hike are a joke 
(March 27). It appears that the PUC blames the consumers for the current 
power problems and not the greedy power companies or the lame-duck 
politicians in Sacramento. Greedy people artificially generate this problem. 
Electricity is not a luxury item, but it appears to be becoming one for many 
people. This rate hike is another reason for business to stay out of 
California or to leave. California has driven many companies out already. 
California's economy will suffer and will pay the penalty for this artificial 
mess.

I have sat back looking at what the electrical system has been deregulated to 
in the last five years. Loretta Lynch, president of the PUC, now says we have 
to pay over 40% more on our bills. (Cheap power under deregulation.) What 
spot is she looking for in Bush's Cabinet? The PUC, state Energy Commission, 
FERC and Legislature all have their hands in the pot making it worse by the 
day. 
The private companies were doing just great until those loud-mouthed consumer 
advocates got hold of the public ear and lied through their teeth. The public 
better look at what's going on real close so they know whom to vote for next 
election.

Cal-ISO, the independent electrical system operator, has recently released 
figures which show that between December 1999 and December 2000 demand for 
electricity increased by less than 1%. Our bills have already gone up, and 
now the knuckleheads at the PUC are suggesting that we raise rates by 40%! 
What are these people doing, and who is representing the interests of the 
citizens over the interests of Duke Energy, Reliant Energy, Enron Corp., et 
al.? We've been robbed for a year by these gougers, and now they want to 
raise our rates so the robbers can reap even bigger profits than the 200% to 
500% gains this year? I smell a revolution coming.

generation companies made good profits when they sold energy for as little as 
10% of what they are able to charge now. I don't buy it. And I don't buy the 
argument that gas ""costs"" have gone sky-high. Gas ""costs"" are the same. The 
gas companies have also found ways to just charge more for the same thing. 
Now, with a bought-and-paid-for administration in Washington, they are bold 
enough to just keep on doing it while denying everything. 
I am for canceling deregulation until this group of energy company executives 
are prosecuted, jailed, replaced, made examples of what executives should not 
become, and are just a bad memory.

CEO says Texas in good shape for electricity deregulation
By BETSY BLANEY
Associated Press Writer

03/27/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

DALLAS (AP) - Enron Corp.'s chief executive and president said Tuesday he 
believes that Texas energy markets are in good shape as the state prepares 
for deregulation. 
Jeffrey Skilling told an audience of about 400 business people at a downtown 
hotel that California ""has given the term deregulation a terrible name.""
Electric deregulation in Texas officially starts Jan. 1. ""In Texas, I think 
we've got a pretty good system,"" Skilling said. 
In San Francisco on Tuesday, the California Public Utilities Commission 
unanimously approved electricity rate increases of up to 46 percent to try to 
head off blackouts this summer by keeping the state's two biggest utilities 
from going under. 
When California officials set up deregulation they allowed the price of 
wholesale electricity to rise but capped the amount companies could charge 
customers, Skilling said. SoCal Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric say they 
have lost more than $13 billion since last summer because they haven't been 
able to pass on the high cost of wholesale electricity. 
Skilling said Texans are in a much better position and shouldn't worry that 
their state's deregulation would be like the California experience. 
""California, they just put together a crazy system,"" Skilling said in his 
first public comments since becoming the Houston-based company's chief 
executive officer in February. ""The markets in California are the most 
regulated markets in North America today. And that's what is causing the 
problem."" 
Enron, the largest energy trader, has been attacked by Californians who 
accuse it of price-gouging. In a swipe at Enron and other traders, Gov. Gray 
Davis said the state should never again allow ""out-of-state profiteers to 
hold Californians hostage."" 
In Texas this week, lawmakers picked apart the economics of their 1999 
electric-deregulation law that allowed utilities to charge customers 
higher-than-necessary rates to make up for money they were expected to lose 
through investments in nuclear power and coal plants. 
Although nuclear and coal plants were expected to lose value in an 
unregulated market, their value instead increased as soaring natural gas 
prices made gas-fired power plants more expensive to operate. Utilities with 
coal and nuclear plants have reaped extra profits for utilities. 
One legislator is sponsoring a bill to force utility companies to refund 
customers an estimated $7 billion in overcharges allowed under the 
electric-deregulation law passed last session. 
Deregulation is expected to attract close to 20 power companies - including 
newcomers from outside Texas - who will compete for a slice of the 
residential, commercial and industrial market.

Power companies gear up for deregulation pilot program

03/27/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

AUSTIN (AP) - Power companies are jockeying for the next phase in electric 
deregulation - a pilot program to let some customers pick their own power 
company beginning June 1. 
In Dallas, competitors hope to lure customers from TXU Corp. are advertising 
heavily in newspapers and over the air waves.
About 20 companies have signed up with state officials to become electricity 
providers, ranging from existing companies to new entrants to the market such 
as New Power Co. and Shell Energy. 
New Power, a spinoff of Enron Corp. established to attract mostly residential 
and small business customers, has signed up more than 5,000 customers in the 
past two weeks. 
TXU, which plans to go outside its North Texas base to compete for customers 
in Houston, professes not to be concerned about advertising designed to lure 
its customers away during the 8-month trial program. 
""Why do you want to spend your advertising dollars when at most only 5 
percent of your customers can choose?"" spokesman Chris Schein told the Austin 
American-Statesman. He said TXU will launch a major campaign in January, when 
markets open more broadly. 
""These customers are very astute, and they're going to make every company 
earn their business,"" Schein said. 
During the trial program beginning June 1, up to 5 percent of a utility's 
customers can switch to another utility. 
Just three weeks into advertising for the pilot program, TXU has more than 
9,000 customers in its service areas interested in other electricity 
providers - about 10 percent of the total that could switch before Jan. 1. 
Houston-based Reliant Energy Inc. has also seen substantial numbers of 
customers switch. 
Only investor-owned utilities such as TXU and Reliant Energy are required by 
Texas law to open their markets to competition on Jan. 1. City-owned 
utilities such as Austin Energy and rural electric cooperatives can choose to 
compete. 
The pilot program has drawn the most interest among large commercial 
customers, said Gary Rasp, a manager in the Austin office of 
Burson-Marsteller, a public-relations agency that the state hired to explain 
deregulation to Texans. 
Smaller businesses have been much slower to embrace electric choice because 
electricity is not as big an expense for them, Rasp said.

USA: Enron CEO says Calif. rate hike will help.

03/27/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

DALLAS, March 27 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. , North America's biggest buyer and 
seller of electricity and natural gas, on Tuesday said a 40 percent hike in 
California electricity rates would help reduce shortages there but more 
deregulation is needed. 
Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling said he expected California's power shortfalls 
this summer to drive prices for natural gas above $10 from current prices 
around $5 per thousand cubic feet.
""This summer under standard weather conditions that shortfall is likely to be 
5,000 megawatts,"" Skilling told a Dallas luncheon hosted by Southern 
Methodist University's Cox School of Business. 
Skilling said the rate hike, approved by California's Public Utilities 
Commission, could reduce that power shortfall. But power generators will 
still be scrambling for natural gas for power plants, driving the price 
higher and drawing supply away from industrial uses. 
""That could mean very high prices. I can easily conceive of something north 
of $10, potentially around $15,"" Skilling said. 
Asked by reporters about the impact of the California rate hike, Skilling 
said it was ""a huge step forward in reducing the odds of shortfalls"". 
""To date I don't think anyone has been willing to let prices rise to help 
balance supply and demand.... This is step number one,"" he said. 
But he said a permanent fix to the state's power crunch would require genuine 
deregulation, which he said had not been achieved under California's current 
system. 
Skilling said he expected demand pressure to keep natural gas prices high for 
several years until demand can be curbed or new production be brought into 
play, possibly by increasing the import of liquefied natural gas. 
Building new facilities for shipping liquefied gas, storing it and returning 
it to gaseous form for burning would be expensive but could be attractive as 
long as natural gas prices remain above $3.50 per thousand cubic feet, he 
said. 
""That will take the edge off prices in four or five years,"" he said. 
Skilling reaffirmed Enron's projected earnings per share of $1.70-$1.75 in 
2001. ""We're on track. We're very comfortable"" with that estimate, he told 
reporters.

USA: Enron rewards Lay with $7 mln bonus.

03/27/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

WASHINGTON, March 27 (Reuters) - Electricity and natural gas marketing 
company Enron Corp., coming off an ""extremely strong"" 2000, rewarded Chairman 
Kenneth Lay with a 79 percent boost to his bonus, Enron said on Tuesday. 
Lay's 2000 bonus shot up to $7 million from $3.9 million in 1999, the 
Houston-based company said in its annual proxy statement filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission.
""In recognition of Enron's extremely strong performance during 2000 relative 
to recurring after-tax net income and other financial measures, Mr. Lay 
received a cash annual incentive award of $7,000,000,"" said the company. 
Enron determined the figure by taking into account the pay level for the head 
of a company of comparable revenue size as well as increases in total 
recurring net income and earnings per share, according to the proxy. 
Lay's base salary last year was $1.3 million, unchanged from 1999. He also 
received $7.5 million in restricted stock awards as well as options for 
782,830 shares that could be valued at $35 million if Enron's stock 
appreciated 10 percent annually over the life of the options. 
Most of the options expire on January 10, 2007 and can be exercised at $47.31 
a share. 
Enron's stock was at $60.08 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange, down $1.40. Over the past 52 weeks the shares have been as low as 
$51.55 and as high as $90.56.

Powergen, Innogy Look to Profit From New Power System (Update1)
2001-03-27 06:19 (New York)

Powergen, Innogy Look to Profit From New Power System (Update1)

     (Adds company comment in 17th paragraph.)

     London, March 27 (Bloomberg) -- Powergen Plc, Innogy Plc and
other large generators will benefit from a new system of trading
power in the U.K., while nuclear and renewable-energy producers
may find the rules harder going, analysts and executives said.
     The New Electricity Trading Arrangements, or NETA, start
today after a five-month delay. Powergen, Britain's third-biggest
generator, Innogy, the top power supplier, and U.S. rivals such as
TXU Corp. are hoping their mix of coal and natural gas-fired
generation will allow them to make more money trading electricity.
     ``There will be winners and losers,'' said Angelos
Anastasiou, an analyst at Williams de Broe. ``Companies best
placed to survive and thrive under the NETA system are the ones
that have a flexible portfolio of generation.''
     Unlike California, where a shortage of generation has led to
surging prices and blackouts in recent months, the U.K. has more
capacity than it needs. The market regulator, Ofgem, hopes NETA
will increase competition in an electricity market it values at
7.5 billion pounds ($6.7 billion) a year, leading to lower prices.
     Wholesale power prices have fallen about 15 percent in the
last year as companies prepared for NETA, though there is room for
further declines, according to Ofgem.
     ``Since privatization, generating costs have come down by
between 25 percent and 40 percent, but this has not been reflected
in prices,'' Ofgem Chief Executive Callum McCarthy said in a
statement issued by Regulatory News Service.
     Under previous rules, generators facing a temporary supply
interruption weren't penalized if they didn't deliver. Under NETA,
a company that can't produce power it agreed to supply must buy it
on the market. As a result, generators able to supply power from
different sources are most likely to benefit, analysts said.

                    Interruptions

     In addition, the biggest utilities with excess capacity will
also profit from supplying other generators with short-term power
-- at high prices -- when they must buy to meet NETA obligations.
Nuclear plants, which must be run at full output, and companies
that generate power from wind and sun are not so flexible.
     The previous ``pool'' trading system, set up in 1990 when the
U.K. started selling power assets to the public, is run by the
National Grid Group Plc, operator of the country's high-voltage
transmission network.
     National Grid combines all offers from generators to sell
electricity and picks the lowest-priced offers until demand is
filled. The system is restricted to filling market imbalances
about three-and-a-half hours before they appear.
     ``The issue is the flexibility of plant,'' said Carolyn
McAdam, a spokesman for Scottish and Southern. ``Our dual-turbine
gas plants are designed to be easy to switch on and off.''
     British Energy Plc, the U.K.'s biggest generator, has been
looking to diversify its production away from a reliance on
nuclear energy. In March last year, it bought Eggborough coal-
fired power-station for 615 million pounds.

                    Pork Bellies

     The agreements will allow electricity to be traded in much
the same way as pork bellies, gas or any other commodity, industry
officials said.
     Innogy, the U.K. generator spun off from National Power Plc
last year, employs 70 people on its trading floor in Swindon,
England. TXU Europe also hopes to make money trading electricity
contracts, as does Enron Corp., the world's largest energy trader.
     ``We'll be trading across the board under NETA,'' said TXU
Europe spokesman Chris Judge.
     Powergen spent 25 million pounds over two years to prepare
for NETA, Chief Executive Nick Baldwin said in an RNS statement.
The company's systems are ``interfacing well with the central
system and that of the National Grid Company'' today, he said.
     Designed and to address concerns the price of electricity was
being manipulated under the ``pool'' system, smaller producers say
the new arrangements are biased towards bigger companies.
     ``The NETA program has always said it will create a level
playing field but that's a load of hot air,'' said Steve Garrett,
commercial manager of Slough Heat and Power Ltd. ``From a small
generators point of view, (today) is the not `go live' date but
the `go dead' date.''

                    Wind Power

      Martin Edwards, owner of a Wind Electric Ltd., a wind power
plant in Cornwall, England, which supplies enough energy each year
for 2,700 households, says the new system will reduce the price
that he charges for electricity by as much as 50 percent.
     ``Wind farms will just about be able to cover their costs
under NETA,'' and nothing further, he said.
    To be sure, Ofgem said last week it will investigate the
effect of NETA on small generators, and the government has said
10 percent of all electricity consumed by 2010 will come from
renewable generation sources.

                    Market Conditions

     With its abundant generation, some companies argue that NETA
isn't necessary because the market situation it was created to
address no longer exists.
     The electricity market, once dominated by National Power
and Powergen, has become more competitive, with foreign rivals
taking a bigger slice of the market and driving prices down.
     National Power and Powergen have seen their market share
shrink over the past 10 years. Companies such as ScottishPower
Plc, which last year bought a natural gas-fired power station from
Powergen for 220 million pounds, have also increased rivalry.
     And there's no reason to fear California-style shortages
resulting from NETA, said Ofgem. There haven't been blackouts in
Britain that weren't weather related in almost 30 years.
     ``In terms of the average price achieved, the advent of NETA
will probably not make much difference,'' said Williams de Broe's
Anastasiou. ``We will get more price volatility, but it remains to
be seen what NETA's real impact will be.''

U.S. Companies Push for Private Lenders to Finance Exports

     Washington, March 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., Lucent
Technologies Inc. and other U.S. companies are pressing the Export-
Import Bank to let private lenders offer export financing, a
system that could provide billions of dollars in additional
funding for U.S. sales overseas.
     The Ex-Im bank should counter the ``market window'' financing
used by Canada and other U.S. trading partners that enables banks
to offer export loans at the lower costs government agencies
offer, the companies told an Ex-Im Bank advisory panel.
     The bank, an independent federal agency, hasn't taken a
position on the practice, which would require congressional
approval.
     ``Ex-Im is behind the curve,'' said Rebecca McDonald,
chairman and chief executive of Enron Global Assets, a division of
Enron Corp. that develops power projects in Latin America and
Asia. ``There needs to be a fundamental change in Ex-Im's
philosophy and business practices.''
     Businesses are seeking the change, at the same time they are
fighting a 25 percent cut in the Ex-Im Bank budget proposed by
President George W. Bush. Bush wants to reduce funding for the
bank, which lends to foreign buyers of U.S. goods, to $699 million
from $927 million.

                        Growing Concern

     Concern about the budget ``only magnifies the other concerns
that exporters have with respect to ensuring that the agency is
competitive,'' said Mary Irace, vice president at National Foreign
Trade Council. ``Without money, who can be competitive?''
     The trade council represents 500 companies, including
engineering company Bechtel Group Inc. and Enron, the world's
largest energy trader, and U.S. units of foreign companies such as
Asea Brown Boveri AG, the world's biggest electrical-engineering
company.
     If Ex-Im used market-window financing as much as Canada and
Germany, which use the practice most, the agency could increase
the scale of its operations by more than 50 percent to about $20
billion, said Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Institute for
International Economics, a Washington research group.
     Market window financing wouldn't cost the U.S. government
more money, yet current law would require additional funding in
case some of the loans need to be written off, Hufbauer said.
     The Ex-Im Bank supported foreign transactions worth $12.6
billion with loans, guarantees and export-credit insurance in
2000.
     Bush's plan to cut funding faces opposition from Republicans,
the majority party in Congress. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, an
Illinois Republican, said lawmakers will probably restore the
funding, and 30 Republican senators have asked Bush to change
course.
     The agency's top official said he expects an increased focus
on market-window financing, which Peter Derrick, Lucent's
assistant treasurer said has grown during the past decade in other
countries.
     ``Market windows will get a lot of attention in the months
ahead,'' said James Harmon, Ex-Im's chairman and president.
``Everybody will focus on it.''

USA: UPDATE 1-Enron CEO says stock hit because of high multiple.
By C. Bryson Hull

03/28/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW ORLEANS, March 28 (Reuters) - Wall Street's stampede away from stocks 
with high price to earnings (PE) ratios is finally catching up with Enron 
Corp. and hurting its share price, the energy giant's top executive said on 
Wednesday. 
""I think the stock price dropped because of multiple compression,"" Enron 
President and Chief Executive Jeff Skilling told an audience of institutional 
investors at the Howard Weil Energy Conference in New Orleans.
Enron currently trades at about 41 times earnings, a value Skilling said he 
considers ""low and clearly sustainable moving forward."" 
His comments came as Enron shares dropped as much as 5 percent Wednesday, 
before closing down $2.36, or 3.9 percent, at $58.10 in trading on the New 
York Stock Exchange. Enron's fall outpaced the less than one percent drop in 
the Standard & Poor's Utility Index. 
Skilling pointed to the wave of companies whose prices have dropped sharply 
in the last year because investors thought they were overvalued, with PE 
multiples above 30 times earnings range. 
""We kept our multiple and felt a little like the last duck in the pond and 
there was still a lot of ammo with the hunters,"" Skilling said. 
Enron's stock remained immune to the trend against high PE ratios until last 
week, when it dropped under $60 for the first time since January 2000. It 
lost 8 percent over a two-day period, March 21-22, prompting Skilling to hold 
a conference call last Friday to assuage investors and analysts. 
One analyst said several Enron-specific issues have more to do with the 
recent decline in the company's share price than the broader market disregard 
for high PE ratio stock. 
""He is exactly right that high multiple stocks have sold off, and you see 
that particularly in the NASDAQ. Telecoms and the tech sector have been hit 
hard and Enron had a large part of its valuation in the telecom sector with 
broadband,"" Commerzbank securities analyst Andre Mead said. 
The market took that value out as telecoms weakened across the board and as 
some doubts arose about Enron's timing on its broadband initiative and other 
issues, he said. 
""The bottom line is there are some market dynamics at work for at least a 
portion of the sell-off, but a good deal of it is Enron-specific, because the 
market is valuing the broadband (part) less,"" Meade said. 
The fall in its shares last week followed a rapid string of negative news 
about Enron, including continuing word that India's Maharastra State 
Electricity Board could not pay Enron for power from its Dabhol power plant; 
the termination of the broadband unit's marquee 20-year video deal with 
Blockbuster Inc. ; and false rumors of layoffs at the broadband unit. 
Enron has peaked at $90.56 and touched a low of $51.55 over the past 12 
months.

USA: ICE to offer Internet products trade off Colonial Pipeline.

03/28/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, March 28 (Reuters) - Internet-based IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) 
plans to offer trading in U.S. refined products off the Colonial Pipeline in 
the second quarter of this year, a company official said Wednesday. 
The Houston-to-New York Colonial Pipeline is the largest refined products 
pipeline in the United States, pumping a total of 2.35 million barrels per 
day of gasoline, heating oil, diesel and jet fuel.
Refined oil prices for the nation's refining hub on the Gulf Coast are set by 
trade into the pipeline. 
ICE however would not elaborate on which products exactly it will trade. 
""That's the plan, but we don't really have any further details,"" said a 
company official. 
With backing from major banks and energy groups, ICE (https://www.intcx.com) 
has become one of the most widely distributed online energy marketplaces, 
despite only launching trading last fall. 
It hosts a range of energy and precious metal 'over the counter' (OTC) 
contracts - those traded outside regular futures exchanges. Oil derivatives 
traded on ICE include crude oil, fuel oil, heating oil, jet fuel, gasoline 
and naphtha. 
But with an average of $3.5 billion in daily trade volume, rival Enron Corp 
(ENE.N) subsidiary EnronOnline (www.enrononline.com) has been the most 
successful online energy trading platform. 
While it does not currently offer trading of Colonial Pipeline products, an 
EnronOnline official did not rule out such a move in the future. 
""We have been making additions pretty much every month,"" the official said. 
""If we get demand for Colonial, I'm sure we'll add it. We're making large 
efforts to expand that product area."" 
This week, EnronOnline launched trading in WTI crude options and spread 
trading in Light Louisiana Sweet/St. James, West Texas Sour/Midland and West 
Texas Intermediate/Midland crudes.

US FERC To Seek Input On Regional Pwr Grid Coordination
By Bryan Lee

03/28/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission agreed 
Wednesday to seek comment on whether it should hold a technical conference on 
the coordination of wholesale power transactions among the regional 
transmission organizations, or RTOs, that it seeks to develop.
FERC is in the midst of implementing a sweeping order that will direct the 
utilities it regulates to turn over control of their transmission assets to 
RTOs. 
The order aims to promote more liquid regional wholesale power markets by 
creating independent power-grid operators, removing the remaining ability of 
vertically integrated utilities to use control of transmission to competitive 
benefit in power markets. 
In December, competitive power suppliers and industrial consumers petitioned 
the commission to convene a technical conference on what was termed the 
""seams"" issue involving wholesale power transactions from one 
RTO-administered grid area to another. 
""The transmission grid for electricity is interstate and inter-regional,"" 
said John Anderson, executive director of the Electricity Consumers Resource 
Council, or ELCON, which represents large industrial power users. 
""We must be sure that, first, RTOs coordinate transmission facilities of 
different utilities, but, second - and probably more important - we must 
ensure that transmission facilities coordinated by each RTO are also 
coordinated"" among one another, Anderson said. 
If the ""seams"" issue isn't addressed, ""RTOs could soon resemble huge speed 
bumps which could not just slow down, but do permanent harm to the vehicle of 
competition,"" he said. 
ELCON was joined in the petition by the Electric Power Supply Association, 
which represents competitive power producers and marketers, and by Enron 
Power Marketing Inc. (ENE), Reliant Energy Power Generation (REI) and Dynegy 
Inc. (DYN). 
FERC commissioners noted Wednesday that they soon will issue a notice seeking 
comment on the issues raised by the petition, and whether the commission 
should grant the request for a technical conference. 
Commissioner William Massey welcomed the decision, noting that the lack of 
standardized procedures could pose ""an impediment to trade."" 
Massey called for FERC to shepherd an industry-wide effort to develop 
consistent standards for information and terminology regarding scheduling and 
reservation of transmission capacity among RTOs, - including the development 
of ""generic interface procedures."" 
FERC spurred a similar standardization process in the natural gas industry, 
which resulted in creation of a Gas Industry Standards Board, or GISB. 
GISB produced uniform communications protocols for reserving pipeline 
capacity and standardized business practices, Massey noted, expressing the 
desire for the electric industry to do the same. 
ELCON was reserved in reacting to FERC's response to the petition, since the 
commission could ultimately decide against holding the technical conference. 
""We think recent events in California and the possibility of additional 
supply disruptions in other areas of the country highlight the need for 
inter-regional coordination,"" said Marc Yacker, ELCON's director of 
government and public affairs. 
""We continue to hope that FERC will address this issue,"" Yacker said. ""The 
closer we get to larger, more liquid regional wholesale power markets, the 
better off we'll be."" 
The issue arose as FERC Wednesday approved an RTO for Florida. Ordinarily, 
FERC wouldn't approve a single-state RTO, but did given that the state is a 
peninsula. 
However, the Electric Power Supply Association, for which the bottleneck for 
sales into Florida is a big concern, raised the ""seams"" petition in that 
proceeding. 
The commission also must confront the issue in hashing out an RTO for the 
U.S. Midwest. FERC has approved two different grid entities in the region, 
the Alliance Regional Transmission Organization and the Midwest Independent 
System Operator. 
FERC has granted RTO status to the for-profit Alliance effort, in which 
participating utilities aim to spin off their transmission assets to create 
an independently traded transmission company. 
Earlier this year, FERC issued an order establishing an administrative 
proceeding designed to develop a merger agreement between the for-profit 
Alliance and the nonprofit Midwest ISO. 
The commission must act in the near future on an agreement struck in that 
proceeding that would maintain the Alliance and Midwest ISO as two separate 
entities, but operating under a single design for providing transmission 
services across the two entities. 
An attorney involved in the negotiations, who asked to remain anonymous, said 
the agreement illustrated that such ""seams"" arrangements could obviate the 
need for FERC to order establishment of RTOs encompassing broad geographic 
regions.

Top Enron executives reap bonuses for strong 2000 performance

03/28/2001

Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - Energy marketing powerhouse Enron Corp. rewarded chairman 
Kenneth Lay with a $7 million bonus for the company's performance last year, 
a 79 percent increase from the year before. 
According to a March 2 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
the compensation committee of the Enron board of directors decided Lay, who 
was chief executive officer until last month, get an increase from his $3.9 
million bonus in 1999.
""We believe that Enron's executive compensation program has contributed 
significantly to the increase in shareholder value from 1991 to 2000, during 
which time a shareholder who invested $100 in Enron common stock would have 
received $1,497 or a 1,397 percent increase in value, compared to 391 percent 
for the S&P 500 and 534 percent for industry peers,"" the committee explained 
in the company's proxy statement. 
Lay's base salary remained flat at $1.3 million. 
Similarly, Enron president Jeffrey Skilling - who took over as chief 
executive officer in February - saw his bonus increase to $5.6 million from 
$3 million in 1999. Skilling's salary remained flat at $850,000. 
Enron, the nation's largest natural gas and wholesale electricity marketer, 
saw a 32 percent increase in 2000 profits to $1.3 billion. 
Shares of Enron were down $2.44 to $58.02 in afternoon trading Wednesday on 
the New York Stock Exchange.

USA: Viacom nixes plan to spin off rest of Blockbuster.
By Derek Caney

03/28/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, March 28 (Reuters) - Entertainment titan Viacom Inc. confirmed on 
Wednesday it will scrap plans to spin off its remaining about 82 percent 
stake in Blockbuster Inc. , saying it was happy with the performance of the 
video retail unit and wanted to keep it in the Viacom family. 
A spokeswoman said the company, which owns the CBS television network, 
Paramount Pictures and MTV among other entertainment properties, would 
disclose its plans in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 
the next couple of days.
""We're very happy with Blockbuster's performance,"" the Viacom spokeswoman 
told Reuters. ""We're pleased with the cash it generates. Blockbuster provides 
a lot of free cash flow for Viacom."" 
The spokeswoman declined to comment on the possibility of Viacom buying back 
the outstanding 18 percent of Blockbuster shares, which total about 175 
million as of the end of December. 
The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that Viacom was giving up on 
plans to split off Blockbuster, which has about 4,800 retail stores. 
Viacom took the minority Blockbuster stake public in August 1999 at $15, but 
it failed to generate much enthusiasm. Company executives said later that 
year it would not offer any remaining stock until its share price hit the 
$20-range. 
Viacom executives have said repeatedly in the past that they believed 
Blockbuster's shares were undervalued. 
Blockbuster reached a high of $17 in November 1999, before crumbling against 
the backdrop of investor belief that technology would dramatically change the 
movie distribution business and would leave retailers, who rely on customers 
visiting video stores, in the dust. Shares dropped to a low of $6.88 in 
October 2000. 
The increased popularity of satellite television and new digital cable 
technology, which compresses cable signals to allow hundreds of cable 
channels, and the specter of video-on-demand from a variety of services also 
has scared many investors away from Blockbuster, analysts said. 
""Blockbuster has been something of a conundrum to investors,"" said SG Cowen 
analyst Ed Hatch. ""Its shares have suffered under a cloud that technology 
will make its stores obsolete."" 
But Gerard Klauer Mattison & Co. analyst Jeffrey Logsdon noted that despite 
the threat of technological advances, the company has made considerable 
strides. 
""The company has dramatically redesigned its capital spending in the last 
couple of years,"" he said, citing the retailer's revenue sharing deals with 
film studios, in which the company shares video rental revenue in exchange 
for cheaper prices for the new video releases it buys. 
Logsdon also noted that the company has cut its new store additions, ""which 
has potentially added between $100 million and $150 million a year in free 
cash flow. 
""With those two elements, Blockbuster becomes a significant cash cow and it 
becomes perhaps less necessary to have Blockbuster separate,"" he added. 
Indeed, in the last few months, Blockbuster has staged something of a 
turnaround, rebounding to its current level of $13.98, up 5 percent, or 68 
cents, in Wednesday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Earlier in 2000, Blockbuster announced several initiatives to take advantage 
of its brand name. It signed a deal with electronics retailer RadioShack 
Corp. to open up a ""store-within-a-store"" within RadioShack shops. 
It also struck a marketing agreement with satellite television provider 
DirecTV in which the two companies would jointly offer pay-per-view movies 
via DirecTV, while Blockbuster will promote and sell the satellite systems 
and services in its stores. 
DirecTV is owned by General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Electronics Corp. . 
Blockbuster's video-on-demand joint venture with Enron Corp. , however, was 
less successful, unravelling earlier this month with both companies saying 
they would pursue separate services. 
Viacom shares were off 3.5 percent, or $1.60, to $44.65 in Wednesday's NYSE 
trading, although analysts attributed the weakness to pessimism in the media 
sector overall following Walt Disney Co.'s announcement late Tuesday that it 
would slash its work force by 4,000, or 3 percent.

NIGERIA: Nigeria will break up state power monopoly - minister.

03/28/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

ABUJA, March 28 (Reuters) - Nigeria said on Wednesday it would end the 
monopoly of state electricity giant NEPA and split it into many different 
companies by the end of the of the year. 
Minister of Power and Steel Segun Agagu told reporters the cabinet approved 
the plan which had been incorporated in a bill to be presented to the 
national assembly.
""The centrepiece of the proposed policy is the unbundling of NEPA into 
several generation, distribution and marketing companies,"" he said. 
Nigeria suffers from a chronic power shortage that leaves whole areas blacked 
out sometimes for weeks. 
NEPA is already slated for privatisation. The government's formula is to sell 
40 percent to a core investor, retain 40 percent for the state and sell 20 
percent to the public. 
Its target is to generate 4,000MW of electricity by the end of this year 
compared with a current 2,500MW. 
Agagu said eight companies would be created in NEPA's power generation and 
over 20 companies in distribution and marketing. 
""Interested local and foreign companies will be given franchises for 
distribution and marketing of electricity in some states or a combination of 
states,"" he added. 
Nigeria has 36 states and in Lagos, the richest and most populous, U.S. 
energy giant Enron Corp is already working on a project to supply 270MW of 
electricity. 
The Nigerian minister said in the generation sector, Kainji and Jebba, both 
hydro power stations on the River Niger could be constituted into one 
company. 
""There is no reason why we cannot generate energy in huge quantum in this 
country and sell the same in other countries in the West African sub-region,"" 
Agagu said. 
""The essence of the new policy is to create a competitive market for 
electricity supply in all the states of the federal republic of Nigeria. 
""We are trying to move away from the inefficient public sector control 
monopoly which NEPA is towards a deregulated market where we have private 
sector participation,"" he added.

Enron's unit presents thermal power plan to Aomori gov.

03/28/2001
Kyodo News
Copyright Kyodo News International Inc. 2001

AOMORI, Japan, March 28 -- 
A unit of U.S. energy company Enron Corp. on Wednesday submitted to Aomori 
Gov. Morio Kimura its plan for building a large thermal power plant in the 
village of Rokkasho in the northern Japan prefecture.
Encom Corp. (Japan) President Carey Sloan visited the governor and presented 
the 60-hectare project for a 2-million-kilowatt power plant to be fueled by 
liquefied natural gas (LNG), according to the plan. 
The New York-based affiliate of the Houston-based Enron for power business in 
Japan plans to start constructing the facility in 2004 upon necessary 
administrative approvals and launch its operations in 2007. 
Rokkasho is known as the site of the country's first full-scale nuclear waste 
reprocessing plant. The facility run by Japan Nuclear Fuel Ltd. is set to 
start reprocessing in July 2005. 
According to Encom's plan, the company now is waiting for a reply -- expected 
around June -- from Tohoku Electric Power Co. in order to connect its 
transmission lines to those of the local electric power monopoly. 
Sloan said in a press conference he expects Tohoku Electric to give nod to 
his company's bid to link the lines. 
Kimura issued a statement saying he expects the plan to spur the national 
project to develop the village's 5,300-hectare Mutsu-Ogawara area, where the 
reprocessing plant is located, into an industrial park. 
It is also expected to contribute to boosting the regional economy and 
creating jobs, the statement said.

Regulators grant rate hike for utilities
Rates could rise almost 50 percent under CPUC plan



By Myra P. Saefong, CBS.MarketWatch.com 
Last Update: 5:59 PM ET Mar 27, 2001


?
SAN FRANCISCO (CBS.MW) - California power regulators agreed Tuesday to raise 
electricity rates by almost 50 percent to help the state's cash-strapped 
utilities buy adequate power for their customers as the peak summer usage 
season approaches. 








""Today's rate increase is long over due,"" said Commissioner Richard Bilas, 
prior to the actual vote. The vote came despite objections from hoards of 
protesters outside the meeting in San Francisco to keep power rates stable.
The increase, which was approved 5-0, adds 3 cents per kilowatt hour to rates 
and makes permanent an emergency one cent per kilowatt hour surcharge 
approved on Jan. 4.
Pacific Gas & Electric (PCG: news, msgs, alerts) and Southern California 
Edison (EIX: news, msgs, alerts) have been unable to buy electricity for 
their California customers because they've run up debts of about $13 billion 
paying for power on the open market well above what they received under 
state-capped retail rates. 
Adding another 3 cents per kilowatt hour will ""comprehensively address"" the 
revenues needed in California to keep the state's lights on, CPUC President 
Loretta Lynch said. 
She stressed that the order gives the utilities the right to collect the 
funds immediately, but that customers won't see the increase ""until we design 
new rates."" 
""Over 45 percent of residential customers will not experience a further rate 
increase,"" Lynch said. 
The rate hikes are expected to generate an additional $2.5 billion in annual 
revenue for PG&E and $2.3 billion for Edison. 
California Gov. Gray Davis attempted to distance himself from the move. ""The 
PUC's action today was premature because we do not have all the appropriate 
financial numbers necessary to make a decision,"" Davis said in a statement. 
""If it becomes clear that a rate increase is absolutely necessary for the 
good of the State, I will support one that is fair and do my duty to convince 
Californians of its necessity.""
In January, the commission, which is dominated by Davis' appointees, denied 
rate hikes of 26 percent being sought by the utilities. The state instead 
began buying power itself on the expectation it could negotiate better prices 
with out-of-state generators. 
Since then California has spent about $4 billion buying power, wiping out 
more than half of the state's budget surplus. 
Analysts were cautious.
The order ""still leaves important questions unanswered and comes with some 
strings attached,"" Steven Fleishman, an analyst at Merrill Lynch said in a 
research note. The order ""deliberately restricts"" the extra revenue from 
being used toward the utilities' past power purchase costs, he said. 
Consumer activists said the move is only the beginning and more rate hikes 
can be expected. ?Watch interview.
The commission's meeting Tuesday brought hoards of protestors, whose presence 
and chants of ""Rate hikes go away. Make the energy companies pay!"" caused 
delays to the proceedings.
But the CPUC's decision will help the power crisis in California, Enron (ENE: 
news, msgs, alerts) CEO Jeff Skilling said Tuesday at the Southern Methodist 
University's Cox School of Business management briefing series in Dallas.
""There's been a need to balance supply and demand and to date I don't think 
anyone has been willing to let the prices rise to help balance supply and 
demand,"" Skilling said. ""So this is a huge step forward in reducing the odds 
of shortfalls.""
Davis said Monday that the ""tiered pricing could promote the conservation 
California needs if structured properly but was not convinced of that by the 
data made available to him last week."" He had hoped that the state's energy 
crisis could be resolved without a rate hike. 
CPUC orders QF payments
The CPUC also ordered California's two biggest utilities to make payments to 
small independent generators, or qualifying facilities, for energy within 15 
days of delivery.
The order directs the utilities to resume payments to QFs within 15 days of 
end of billing period, Commissioner Carl Wood said. If they don't comply, the 
utilities will suffer from penalties equal to the amount owed to the QFs, he 
said.
Wood withdrew, on Monday, his idea for a fixed price payment of $79 per 
megawatt hour. 
During a conference call to note holders late Tuesday, Edison's CFO Ted 
Craver, Jr. said SoCal Edison plans to make interest payments on some of its 
defaulted debts, with the first payment on some commercial paper outstanding 
made around the end of next week. 
Craver also said that with the utility's planned payments and its commitment 
to make interest payments, starting this week, as they come due, SoCal Ed 
will become current on all outstanding interest rate payments.
Meanwhile, the CPUC's order regarding payments to QFs came just as the 
state's power grid operator issued a ""Stage Two"" power alert throughout 
California, calling for increased consumer conservation. The Independent 
System Operator said 10,500 megawatts of power were offline due to 
maintenance Tuesday and another 2,900 of QF generation remained unavailable.
The CPUC also ordered Tuesday that the utilities hand over the money they've 
collected for power through retail rates in order to cover the costs of the 
state's Department of Water Resources, which has been buying power on their 
behalf since early this year.
The commission will discuss the details of the issue at its continuation 
meeting next Tuesday, Lynch said.

Hefty payday for Enron's top execs
$7 mln bonus for chairman, $5.6 mln to CEO for 2000 



By Lisa Sanders, CBS.MarketWatch.com 
Last Update: 5:22 PM ET Mar 27, 2001


?
DALLAS (CBS.MW) -- Enron's ability to continually transform itself has 
generated strong results for the Houston-based energy company, CEO and 
President Jeffrey Skilling said Tuesday.








His remarks, made to members of the Dallas business community attending 
Southern Methodist University's Cox School of Business management briefing 
series, came on the same day that Enron (ENE: news, msgs, alerts) filed its 
annual proxy statement.
In the proxy, Enron's financially robust 2000 translated into healthy bonuses 
for both Skilling and Chairman Kenneth Lay. Lay's bonus shot up to $7 million 
in 2000 from $3.9 million in 1999, while Skilling took home $5.6 million in 
bonus pay, up from $3 million the previous year. Enron named Skilling CEO in 
February.
The No. 1 buyer and seller of natural gas in the U.S. and the leading 
wholesale power marketer had $100.8 billion in sales in 2000, up from $20.36 
billion in 1997. During the same period, its earnings-per-share increased to 
$1.47 from 87 cents a share, a 25 percent gain, and its market cap climbed to 
$62.5 billion from $12.8 billion.
Last week, Enron's market cap declined on rumors, which the company denied in 
a press release and subsequent conference call, of problems in its broadband 
business. Shares of Enron, which set a 52-week low of $51.51 a share on March 
22, shed $1.02 to close at $60.46 on Tuesday.
On Tuesday, Skilling said he expected bandwidth trading, now a nominal part 
of Enron's overall business, to contribute 10 to 15 percent to the company's 
bottom line in the next four to five years.
In a conference call Friday, Skilling reiterated that Enron remains 
comfortable with its previously announced profit target of $1.70 to $1.75 a 
share in 2001. The average estimate of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson 
Financial is $1.74 a share.
On Tuesday, Skilling maintained his view and also said the company is 
comfortable with expectations for a profit of 45 cents a share in the March 
quarter.
Enron a business maverick
""Enron has changed the way a lot of people think about the energy business,"" 
Skilling said. ""The one good idea is that the traditional, rigid, 
capital-intensive vertically integrated business structures...are breaking 
down.""
Skilling, who received a bachelor degree from SMU, said its better to search 
for the highest quality products and assemble them into a package for 
delivery to customers rather than owning them all. He said that the business 
model is superior because it's cheaper and more flexible.
""Virtual integration will beat vertical integration every day,"" said 
Skilling, predicting that in the future people will work for the system, 
rather than the product, and that physical capital will be replaced with 
intellectual capital. Enron, he said, created the packaging concept back in 
the late 1980s and assembled it in a way that enables energy to be delivered 
at lower costs.
""That's what led to the growth at our company,"" he said. Skilling said he 
intends for Enron to be the most innovative company in America for years to 
come.

US-Based Enron Corp Expands Pulp And Paper Ops In Asia

03/29/2001

SINGAPORE -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE), one of the world's leading energy 
and communications companies based in Texas, is expanding its pulp and paper 
operations in Asia. 
The power and energy giant is busy setting up offices in Asia that will 
provide price risk management tools for the Asian pulp and paper industry, a 
senior Enron official told Dow Jones Newswires Thursday, on the sidelines of 
an industry gathering in Singapore.
""Asia accounts for 30% of the (world's pulp and paper) market. You can't 
ignore it,"" he said. 
In January this year, Enron opened shop in Singapore and Japan. Japan is one 
of Asia's biggest paper producers and consumers. 
He said that Enron is eyeing to set up shop in India, China and South Korea 
as these countries have ""big market potential."" 
China and South Korea are among the top three biggest paper consumers in 
Asia. 
India is regarded by most analysts as one of the fastest growing newsprint 
consumers in the region. The official declined to comment further on specific 
expansion plans and targets. 
Meanwhile, he said that their customers in Singapore and Japan have logged on 
the www.clickpaper.com - a business-to-business portal for pulp, paper and 
wood products - that was built by Enron. 
Www.clickpaper.com is an Internet-based market for buying and selling pulp, 
paper and wood products. 
In the last three years, the company was able to establish a foothold in the 
American and European pulp and paper markets. 
While the company is well known as a major supplier of natural gas and 
electricity, it started to branch out to the pulp and paper business in 1997, 
as it is one of the biggest consumers of natural gas and electricity in the 
U.S. 
Aside from providing price risk management tools, Enron's offices in the U.S. 
are also involved in buying, selling and producing newsprint.

MUMBAI, March 29 Asia Pulse - The Godbole Committee, set up to review Enron 
promoted Dabhol Power Company's (DPC) 2,184 MW power project and the entire 
power scenario in the western state of Maharashtra, will submit part one of 
its report on April 10 to the state government. 
""The committee will finalise its report on April nine and submit it to the 
government the next day,"" MSEB sources told PTI here today.
According to the committee's schedule, it would first submit the report on 
DPC's project and then commence on part two, comprising study and remedies to 
improve Maharashtra's entire power scenario. 
The sources also did not rule out a possibility of the report being tabled in 
the current session of the on-going state legistlature. 
The six-member committee, set up by the Maharashtra government last month, 
has almost finalised its report today and met financial institutions 
including International Develpoment Finance Corporation Ltd. 
In its over a month-long sittings, the committee discussed the state's review 
proposal with several energy experts including Abhay Mehta, author of the 
controversial book ""Power Play"", which depicted the alleged irregularities in 
the Enron deal. 
Another major presentation, made before the review panel was that by the 
Enron India Chief, K Wade Cline, and the DPC Managing Director, Neil 
McGregor.

$10-m aid gives much-needed fillip

03/29/2001
The Times of India
Copyright (C) 2001 The Times of India; Source: World Reporter (TM)

VADODARA: The Kalpasar project, Gujarat's dream project to turn Gulf of 
Khambhat into a huge fresh water lake, received a major fillip with the 
Netherlands-based Nadeco Company committing $10 million (about Rs 46 crore) 
in aid. 
The state government, in turn, has agreed in principle to accept the aid. 
Chief Minister Keshubhai Patel is sending a four-member team comprising 
Kalpasar Core Committee chairman and chief co-ordinator of the project C C 
Patel, project conceiver Anil Kane, additional secretary U K Sarvaiya and 
secretary Narmada and major irrigation projects M I Mehta to the Netherlands 
in May.
Simultaneously the state government is also setting up a Kalpasar Development 
Authority to administer the funds. Already Rs 18 crore have been poured into 
the project since its conception in mid 1980's. The total project cost is 
estimated at Rs 25,000 crore. 
""This is a major boost to Kalpasar. The Netherlands is known for great dam 
building and if a company of that country has shown interest in our project 
it means big"", Kane told 'The Times of India'. 
He said Kalpasar envisages bridging the Gulf of Khambhat with a 24-km-long 
dam that will connect Bharuch and Bhavnagar. Besides providing drinking and 
irrigation water to the entire Saurashtra and Kutch, Kalpasar will generate 
6000 mega watts of power, Kane said. 
""Saline water will be replaced by fresh water. About 400,000 hectares of land 
that is of no use today will be reclaimed. This fresh water lake than will 
have fantastic harbours and flourishing fisheries,"" Kane said. 
Till date five exhaustive volumes on feasibility of Kalpasar project and six 
survey studies have been put out by the Kalpasar core committee. 
Kane said that Reliance Industries, Larsen and Tubro, Tata Hydel and Tata 
Housing Development have appreciated the 6000 mw power generation aspect of 
the project. ""They have shown keen interest. Some of these companies are even 
enthusiastic to manufacture and supply us turbines against the kind of power 
generation we estimate through Kalpasar,"" Kane said. 
Nadeco, on the other hand, is interested in the building part of the dam. 
""They specialise in building big dams. Holland has one of the world's best 
dams in Islemeher through which they have reclaimed land submerged under the 
sea and converted it into a world floriculture centre. In Kalpasar also they 
see good business opportunity and hence are offering the aid"", Kane observed. 
Nadeco has suggested to the state government that its aid should be used in 
institutional strengthening of the Kalpasar cell. This deals with procuring 
equipment, technology exchange or transfer and manpower. Nadeco has also 
suggested for a GIS, data base on environment baseline, project regime 
modelling and association with Central Water and Power Resources Centre 
(CWPRC) in Pune has also been demanded. The CWPRC's intervention is sought to 
study the impact of Kalpasar on sedimentation, salinity, currents and other 
technical aspects. National Institute of Oceanography's involvement has also 
been sought. 
When asked about the astronomical cost of the project Kane said that the 
major expenditure was on power generation. ""However the power we would 
generate here will be less than Rs 2 a kW for an hour. And unlike Enron, in 
Kalpasar there is no need for foreign exchange"", Kane remarked. He added that 
the other benefits of Kalpasar was that there was no displacement of people 
or inviting natural disasters by disturbing earth's crust. 
""Even if Narmada dam is built to the height of 138 metres, 90 percent of 
Saurashtra and 95 per cent of Kutch would not get water. Kalpasar is a 
feasible alternative and in five years can change the face of Saurashtra and 
Kutch,"" Kane said.

Chanticleer
Qantas Hones A Killer Instinct
John Durie

03/29/2001
Australian Financial Review
36
Copyright of John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd

This time next year, new Qantas boss Geoff Dixon will be running either a $4 
billion or $2.5 billion company, depending almost entirely on factors outside 
his control. 
The higher figure, implying a stock price close to $3 a share, is still a 
long way down, of course, from its $5 billion in market capitalisation in 
August last year before the stock was hit with the combined ills of a 
plunging currency, slowing economy and, worst of worst fears for an airline 
boss competition.
Qantas's stock price is showing the strain considering that this year its 
shareholders have seen returns fall 28.2 per cent after a 9.8 per cent gain 
last calendar year and a 1999 year return of 22 per cent a share. 
All this has happened when more people are flying domestically than ever 
before. In January, 2.6 million people took to the air on 26,000 flights. 
Passenger traffic was up 17.5 per cent on year-ago figures and more planes 
were full, with loads up to 80.8 per cent capacity, the highest level 
recorded in some seven years of monthly data, on Merrill Lynch's reckoning. 
The top routes did even better, with Melbourne-Sydney up 27.6 per cent and 
Brisbane-Sydney up 64.3 per cent. 
Australia now has four domestic carriers, and Qantas's Dixon is about to make 
the problems flowing from increased capacity even worse when he brings in 
planes from routes being closed (to China and Canada). 
His aim is simple: to kill one or more of his competitors because he thinks 
the market cannot sustain four domestic carriers. 
The fact that new capacity is being added now when the money that airlines 
earn from each seat is falling simply raises the stakes, and Dixon has drawn 
a line in the sand. 
With the other major, Ansett, in the middle of its own problems, Dixon is 
working from a position of strength, which is why he has finally declared 
war. 
All these new passengers may look like good business, but if enough are not 
paying full fare, then airline profits fall, particularly if like the present 
market the airlines are hurting, with higher fuel costs and a slowing market. 
But Dixon's war will be a rough ride for his shareholders, as shown by the 
fact that yesterday the company issued its second profit warning in the space 
of a month. 
This sent Qantas's share price to a 21/2-year low and should send a shudder 
through the rest of the domestic market for what it says about general 
economic conditions. 
The only bright spot is that Dixon's warnings are the result of special 
airline industry issues such as massive increases in capacity, which are 
killing yields. 
In the space of seven months, Qantas has gone from a company worth $5.5 
billion to one worth $3.2 billion, a 42 per cent fall, and if Dixon is not 
successful in getting a competitor to close shop, then the stock price will 
head below $2 a share. 
Deutsche has already cut profit forecasts for this year by 20 per cent and 
will slice another 30 per cent after yesterday's warning, bringing this 
year's estimate closer to $302 million than the $392 million the market was 
looking for a couple of weeks ago. 
If Dixon's war campaign is successful, the economy shows more signs of life 
and the old Qantas management team reproduces past cost-control efforts, then 
the stock will be well above $3. 
Between now and then, each time someone takes a $37 flight between Sydney and 
Melbourne, consumer joy means more pain for Dixon and his shareholders. 
Today the BHP Billiton transition team headed by Brad Mills and Mike Salamon 
starts work in Melbourne on the transition arrangements for the new company, 
with the first job being to work out key staff issues and how to lock in 
personnel. 
The company is already well down the track on some operational issues: its 
Venezuelan HBI plant, for example, is expected to be shut; and for tax 
reasons, next year's $3.5 billion steel spin-off will mirror the OneSteel 
sale, with the trade sale option only tested if someone comes in the door 
with a cheque for billions more than book value. 
Two senior executives who won't be around by the end of next year will be Ron 
McNeilly, the BHP minerals boss, and steel man Kirby Adams, who has already 
said he would lead the soon-to-be spun-off company. 
McNeilly's position as an executive director (global markets) is seen more as 
a transitional role, one of ensuring clients are comfortable with the new 
team and aware of the new opportunities. 
Paul Anderson, of course, will also be gone by the end of next year, by which 
time he hopes all the hysteria over where head office really is will have 
died down. 
He didn't even bother testing Don Argus's view on the issue before telling 
Billiton's Brian Gilbertson that Melbourne would have to be the base or, for 
a whole lot of political issues now being aired, there would be no deal. 
Likewise, much of Anderson's time has been spent telling the Billiton board 
that the company will have enough senior executives to qualify still as a 
base for tax and other purchases in the UK, which explains why petroleum boss 
Phil Aiken will be doing time in London. 
In truth, from an operational standpoint, it doesn't matter much where 
Gilbertson spends his time, although he will probably make sure he spends 
fewer than 130 working days a year in Australia lest he be branded an 
Australian executive for tax purposes. 
Anderson, it seems, didn't even think tax was an issue when he did everything 
possible to be an Australian when he first landed, from declaring that he 
followed the St Kilda footy team to asking the Tax Office for a tax file 
number. 
When the combined company gets going, some early new endeavours are clear, 
starting with an energy-trading operation to exploit the fact that the 
company will go long on energy products on three continents through oil, gas, 
LNG and coal and short the product in its aluminium operations, also on three 
continents. 
Another move will be to cut out middle men in operations such as smelting 
where US-based Enron is the combined company's biggest copper producer, 
buying its high-concentrate output, and mixing it with other copper to get 
the lower-concentrate product demanded by the market. 
It would seem to make more sense if BHP Billiton did that job itself. 
While BHP shareholders are handing about $6 billion across to their 
soon-to-be partners at Billiton, in the premium paid for the asset, all will 
be quickly forgotten if, helped by such moves and by the increased liquidity 
from the London link, BHP's stock price climbs much higher.

MSEB to pay Rs 113 cr Feb bill `under protest'
S Ravindran MUMBAI

03/29/2001
Business Standard

Copyright (c) Business Standard

The Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) has decided to pay the Rs 113 
crore February bill to the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) ""under 
protest"". The bill had become due on March 25. 
MSEB has protested primarily about how much power was despatched by DPC on 
demand. ""We have decided to pay the bill but we have disputed the despatch 
figures given by DPC,"" said a highly placed MSEB official.
The decision comes even as the Union law ministry has lobbed the ball back in 
the MSEB-DPC court over the disputed Rs 102-crore December 2000 bill. 
The electricity board had to pay about Rs 102 crore to DPC as the unpaid 
portion of its December bill. DPC first invoked the state government 
guarantee and then the Central government's counter guarantee. 
MSEB had retaliated by slapping a claim of Rs 400 crore on DPC for non supply 
of power at various points between October 2000 and January 28, 2001. 
The state government and MSEB had told the Centre to adjust the December bill 
from the Rs 400 crore (claim) as this was allowed under the power purchase 
agreement (PPA). Their contention was that payment disputes spread over a 
four-month period on non-despatch of power can be adjusted in the December, 
2000 bill. 
DPC contended that the four month period expired on January 25, 2001, when 
the December, 2000 bill fell due. MSEB on the other hand was claiming damages 
primarily for non-despatch of power on January 28, 2001. 
The finance ministry has now referred the matter to the law ministry. It is 
now learnt that attorney-general Soli Sorabjee has contended that there is 
merit in the argument of both sides. If the two parties cannot come to a 
mutually acceptable solution, they can go in for arbitration as stipulated in 
the PPA.

Electricity and natural gas marketing company Enron, coming off an ""extremely 
strong"" 2000, rewarded Chairman Kenneth Lay with a 79% boost to his bonus, 
Enron said Tuesday. 
Lay's 2000 bonus shot up to $7 million from $3.9 million in 1999, the 
Houston-based company said in its annual proxy statement filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission.
Enron determined the figure by taking into account the pay level for the head 
of a company of comparable revenue size as well as increases in total 
recurring net income and earnings per share, according to the proxy. 
Lay's base salary last year was $1.3 million, unchanged from 1999. He also 
received $7.5 million in restricted stock awards as well as options for 
782,830 shares that could be valued at $35 million if Enron's stock 
appreciates 10% annually over the life of the options. 
Most of the options expire Jan. 10, 2007, and can be exercised at 
$47.31/share.

Enron Doing Great, Skilling Says.

03/29/2001

(c) 2001 Energy Intelligence Group. All rights reserved.

If the stock market is going to assign lower share-price-to-earnings ratios, 
then Enron will simply boost its stock price to its former level the 
old-fashioned way - by increasing earnings, President and Chief Executive 
Jeffrey K. Skilling said Wednesday. 
""The stock got hurt quite badly for no apparent reason,"" Skilling said about 
the recent dive in Enron's common-share price. ""The company is doing great. 
In all our businesses, we're seeing some really, really good results,"" he 
told investors at the annual Howard Weil energy conference in New Orleans.
Enron's stock price weakened in the fourth quarter last year along with many 
other high-tech issues after reaching a 52-week high of $90.75 in August. As 
recently as early February the price was about $80. 
Then, Enron was hit with a spate of bad news starting in mid-March (OD 
March22,p6). A bandwidth content arrangement with video distribution giant 
Blockbuster was terminated at the same time the whole high-tech sector was 
collapsing. At one point last week, its price fell to $51.51/share. The price 
recovered to above $60 for a couple of days, but Wednesday it closed at 
$58.10, down $2.36, or 3.9%, on the day. 
The Enron chief executive cited other factors having a negative impact on the 
stock - the overall market revaluation of high price-to-earnings multiples 
and the likely termination of the pending sale of its Portland General 
electric utility subsidiary to Sierra Pacific (OD March27,p8). 
Skilling said Enron will work on improving profitability to achieve its 
previous stock price highs in a market that pays multiples of 30-35 times 
earnings, not the 55 times of 2000, he said.

		COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS: US climate exchange ready to start trading 
Financial Times; Mar 29, 2001
By NIKKI TAIT

		The Chicago Climate Ex-change, a voluntary carbon-dioxide emissions trading 
platform which is being developed on a pilot basis in the Midwest, could 
start trading late this year or early in 2002. 
		Richard Sandor, who is spearheading the project, is expected to tell a US 
Senate committee today that a range of potential participants have expressed 
interest in the exchange - from power utilities to agricultural 
co-operatives. 
		The latter could benefit because they would have carbon dioxide ""offsets"" to 
sell - to the extent that farmers' land-management practices resulted in 
carbon sequestration (the capture and storage of carbon dioxide in the soil). 
		Mr Sandor said yesterday that four co-operatives were discussing 
participation in the exchange, including Midwest-based Growmark. ""Farmers are 
going to be able to produce two crops,"" said Mr Sandor, arguing that 
traditional crop income could be augmented by the environmental credit sales. 
		The Senate committee hearings come at a time when there are some signs of 
increased interest in using emissions trading to help reduce greenhouse gases 
- BP, for example, has instituted an internal carbon- emissions trading 
regime - but the idea remains controversial. 
		The United Nations conference on climate change at the Hague last November 
failed to agree on a legal framework for international emissions trading. 
		Separately, the Chicago Board of Trade, which handles an annual auction of 
sulphur dioxide emissions allowances for the US Environmental Protection 
		Agency, yesterday ann-ounced the second-highest proceeds to date. A total of 
128,388 spot allowances were sold, with an average winning price of Dollars 
174.97 and a clearing price of Dollars 173.57. 
		Enron, the US utility, was the biggest purchaser. The auction of seven-year 
advance allowances produced a clearing price of Dollars 105.72, and an 
average winning price of Dollars 110.75. Proceeds, at Dollars 36.4m, were 
second only to the 1999 figure.

Power project may get a boost
The energy crisis may prompt a new state board to reverse its predecessor's 
ruling on a Southwest Riverside County line.
March 29, 2001

By Sandy Stokes and Thomas Buckley
The Press-Enterprise
Citing renewed debate over the state's energy future, the staff of a state 
power system board says it may be time to reaffirm the need for a new 
electric power line through southern Riverside County. 
If approved by the Independent System Operator board Friday, the 
recommendation would be a setback for power-line opponents who last fall 
thought they had won a round. In October the board ordered that San Diego Gas 
Electric explore alternatives to the high-voltage line before the board 
endorsed the project. 
Also on Friday, the board -- keeper of the state's electric transmission grid 
-- may encourage another look at a second proposal that has caused angst 
among hilltop dwellers on the western edge of the county. 
Last week, SDGE formally applied to the California Public Utilities 
Commission for permission to tap into Southern California Edison's grid by 
building a 31-mile, 500,000-volt transmission line through Riverside County 
to Rainbow, just south of Temecula. The opinion of the board carries weight 
with the PUC. 
The proposed route for SDGE's Valley Rainbow Interconnect slices through 
French Valley horse ranches and crosses Temecula's scenic wine country, 
drawing fire from the area's vintners, residents and some politicians. 
""I'm definitely opposed to that route,"" said Temecula City Councilman Ron 
Roberts. ""It affects everybody."" 
The city and others opposed to the route have until April 22 to lodge 
protests with the PUC, which ultimately will decide whether SDGE can build 
the line. 
Last year, after intense lobbying by Save Southwest Riverside County, the 
grass-roots group opposed to the Valley Rainbow project, the Independent 
System Operator board required SDGE to look for alternatives to the power 
line, including new generating plants. 
But in January, Gov. Davis disbanded the 28-member board and replaced it with 
five of his appointees. The new board Friday will review the previous board's 
decision. 
The agency's staff recommends reaffirming the need for a transmission line 
from Romoland to Rainbow while taking back the requirement that SDGE look for 
alternatives. 
""That's good news,"" said SDGE spokesman Art Larson. Construction on the line 
is scheduled to begin in the summer of 2004 and be completed two years later. 
When the project was first unveiled last summer, the utility's purpose for 
the line was to bring more electricity to its San Diego County customers, 
whom company officials said would begin experiencing blackouts by 2004 
without it. Since then, the energy crisis has spawned several proposals for 
new power plants. Sempra Energy, SDGE's parent company, has proposed two 
large plants in Escondido and Mexicali. 
Now the Independent System Operator staff has recommended that the Valley 
Rainbow project also be considered a vehicle to move new power from Mexico 
and San Diego County into the state's power grid. 
Power-line opponent Barbara Wilder of Save Southwest Riverside County said 
group representatives will attend the board meeting Friday. ""We're going to 
ask them to hold the course they did in October,"" she said. 
Riverside County officials will also be there to ask the board to leave the 
previous decision intact, said management analyst Barbara Dunmore. 
Besides rescinding the previous board's decision, the new board could 
""encourage SDGE to continue to explore alternative routes including a route 
through Forest Service land,"" the agency staff's recommendation states. 
That route, proposed by a group seeking to build a hydroelectric plant near 
Lake Elsinore, would take the transmission line through remote areas of 
Cleveland National Forest. 
A major financial backer of that project, Texas-based Enron North America, 
pulled out, leading some of those who live in the area near the national 
forest to breathe a sigh of relief. 
During the past several months, SDGE told Enron that if the forest route was 
viable, ""we would consider it,"" Larson said. But he said the feasibility of 
the route was never demonstrated. ""Instead, they pulled out of the project,"" 
Larson said. ""That should tell you something."" 
Still, the Independent System Operator staff's recommendation to look at the 
forest route has made the area's residents worried again. 
Elin Motherhead of CAUTION (Citizens Against Unnecessary Transmission lines 
In Our Neighborhood) said the group will continue the fight against the route 
through Cleveland National Forest. 
Gene Frick, a vocal opponent of both the Lake Elsinore hydroelectric power 
plant and the power lines, blasted the agency staff proposal. 
He aimed his strongest criticism at a staff memo that stated: ""The Lake 
Elsinore project is favored by the (U.S.) Forest Service. . . . 
The memo also suggests that in light of Enron's withdrawal, the ""Forest 
Service might be persuaded that if the line is built"" the hydroelectric 
project would become more feasible. 
""That's manifestly false,"" said Frick, pointing to a document the Forest 
Service filed with federal regulators in January calling the proposed Lake 
Elsinore power plant and transmission lines ""inconsistent with the visual 
uality standards and guidelines"" of the Cleveland National Forest. 
Independent System Operator spokesman Patrick Dorinson said the information 
about the Forest Service's alleged view came from Enron. Even so, he said, 
the power board wants SDGE to consider all possible alternatives. 
""I have no idea why the ISO staff put something in there without even 
checking to see if it's true,"" Frick said. ""If this is the kind of stuff 
public servants do, it's no wonder we're in so much trouble.""

Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, March 29 (Reuters) Transwestern Pipeline Co. (TW), a unit of Enron 
, said in a statement on Thursday it planned to install new compression at 
four existing stations in Arizona to boost gas deliveries to energy-starved 
California. 
The company said it had filed an application with the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission (FERC) to expand its system by 150 million cubic feet 
per day (mmcfd) of incremental firm capacity.
TW's total capacity to the California border will increase to 1.24 billion 
cubic feet per day (bcfd). 
The $93 million project is expected to be in service by June 2002. 
""This expansion is a start in meeting the increased demand in California and 
represents additional capacity that can be brought on-line by next summer. 
Transwestern also plans a more extensive expansion in the future,"" said Stan 
Horton, chairman of Enron Transportation Services Company.

El Paso's Calif Gas Play Was Smart,Not Crooked -Analysts
By John Edmiston

03/29/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- When El Paso Merchant Energy bought up most of the 
capacity on a key natural gas pipeline to California, it was taking a 
""gamble"" on higher profits, not trying to corner a market, analysts said.
The auction in which El Paso Merchant Energy bought the capacity from fellow 
El Paso Corp. (EPG) affiliate El Paso Natural Gas was legitimate, and supply 
and demand factors proved the decision sound, they said. 
""El Paso took a gamble on its pipeline capacity, and the fundamentals worked 
out to support their trading position,"" said Kyle Cooper, an energy analyst 
with Salomon Smith Barney in Houston. 
California officials, struggling to cope with soaring power prices that have 
been driven higher in part by spiking prices of natural gas, see things 
differently. The El Paso pipeline is one of only two main links feeding 
energy from the Southwest's natural gas storage pools into California, and 
state officials contend the Houston-based energy company was trying to 
manipulate the price of gas in the state when it bought up capacity in an 
auction early last year. 
Natural gas in southern California has traded much higher than gas in 
northern California in recent months. At their highest, in December, the 
price of gas in southern California spiked to $60 per million British thermal 
units, six times the cost of gas at the other end of the pipeline in Texas. 
Prices spiked again in February and March and remain much higher than the 
price of gas in producing regions. 
The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Wednesday rejected a complaint 
from the California Public Utilities Commission alleging that El Paso Natural 
Gas skewed the bidding process for critical natural gas pipeline capacity 
into California. But the commission ordered an administrative hearing to 
address concerns that El Paso controls too much pipeline capacity and is 
driving up prices at the California border. 
The California Legislature was to examine the allegations in its own series 
of hearings next week. On Monday, The New York Times weighed in, reporting 
that sealed documents filed with FERC suggest El Paso sought to increase its 
profits by manipulating natural gas price spreads between its supply basins 
in Texas and New Mexico and the California energy markets. 
Charlie Sanchez of Gelber & Associates in Houston said it's unlikely any 
wrongdoing will be uncovered. ""This market has become so complicated that 
many don't know the objectively correct answer to the questions at hand,"" 
Sanchez said. ""It's likely the forces at work will be deemed perfectly 
legal."" 
El Paso spokesman Aaron Woods referred requests for comment to previous 
denials of manipulation. 

Charges Are Political - Analyst 

California's charges against are politically motivated, said Ron Barone, an 
analyst with of UBS/PaineWebber Inc. in New York. 
""California needs more pipeline capacity, more power plants, less 
finger-pointing and less resistance to rate hikes that would immediately 
trigger a demand response,"" Barone said. 
The state's gas-transportation shortfall wasn't always apparent. Before last 
year, capacity into California was considered oversupplied, El Paso 
executives say: Demand didn't cover available capacity, so the company 
discounted its prices. California entities have failed to bid realistically 
to renew capacity in auctions over the past three-and-a-half years, Barone 
said, even when cost of that capacity was substantially below the rates 
allowed by regulations. 
For years the capacity on El Paso's line to California never made money, 
Cooper said. As a result, there was little incentive for anyone to build new 
pipelines. 
Demand from power generators has pushed up the state's appetite for gas. 
According to John Somerhalder, president of El Paso's Pipeline Group, 
requests for gas capacity on pipeline expansions into California are running 
more than 12 times what they were a year ago. 
""El Paso had the foresight to take a calculated risk on the value of that 
capacity and it worked in their favor,"" Cooper said. ""If those fundamentals - 
a normal winter and excess demand and lessened storage capacity across the 
country - hadn't worked out, they'd have lost that 8 cents Dynegy was willing 
to pay them."" 
El Paso Merchant Energy reported year 2000 earnings before interest and taxes 
of $563 million, nearly a six-fold increase from adjusted earnings before 
interest and taxes the year before. 
El Paso has said that it couldn't take advantage of the price spikes 
allegedly produced by market manipulation, because it began hedging its risk 
in the middle of last year by selling its gas forward to third parties. By 
the end of the year, it was nearly 90% hedged, Barone said. 
""This hedging capacity is proof that once El Paso actually had capacity, it 
didn't seek to exploit its position to the degree it could have,"" Barone 
said. 
El Paso has also denied restricting capacity to push up prices, saying that 
it used ""virtually all"" of its available capacity to move gas to California. 
Higher energy prices have weighed in on much of the nation this winter, and 
experts expect gas futures prices will peak around $8 per million British 
thermal units later this year. 
Shares in El Paso closed Wednesday up $1.12 at $63.85, compared with a 
52-week high of $75.30. 
Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Transwestern Pipeline covers a similar route to 
California markets. In that case, however, capacity was bought by a number of 
companies with smaller positions.

USA: Maytag farms out energy buying to TXU in 5-year deal.

03/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SAN FRANCISCO, March 29 (Reuters) - Maytag Corp. the No. 3 U.S. appliance 
maker, said Thursday it signed a five-year energy management deal with a TXU 
Corp. unit, following in the steps of a host of other companies trying to cut 
energy costs and boost profits. 
Under the agreement, subsidiary TXU Energy Services will buy or negotiate 
contracts for natural gas, electricity, coal, fuel oil and propane and 
provide consolidated billing and risk management for 14 Maytag manufacturing 
facilities, TXU said in a statement.
The deal, whose financial terms were not made available, is expected to 
provide Newton, Iowa-based Maytag with significant savings on energy 
expenditures by increasing the energy efficiency and reliability of 
manufacturing facilities, both companies said. 
""By consolidating and analyzing multiple bills for facilities in 10 different 
states and Mexico, we can identify problems and come up with individual 
changes that will help lower Maytag's total utility costs,"" Ken Breeden, 
president of TXU Energy Services commercial and industrial division, said in 
the statement. 
Dallas, Texas-based TXU serves more than 8,000 customers in 33 states and has 
completed more than 3,500 energy management projects nationwide, including a 
10-year multimillion dollar energy management agreement in February with 
Aperian Inc. , an Internet service solutions provider. 
Manufacturers nationwide have seen profit margins squeezed in the past 
several months due to a host factors, including high energy costs, excess 
capacity, a decline in exports due to the strength of the dollar and sagging 
consumer confidence. 
Another company that recently signed an energy management deals is drug maker 
Eli Lilli and Co. , which signed a 15-year deal in February with Enron Energy 
Services, a unit of Enron Corp. , to manage its supply of power and natural 
gas. 
Enron Energy Services has also signed deals with the North American arm of 
British glassmaker Pilkington Plc ; Owens-Illinois , one of the world's 
largest glass and plastics makers; and Quaker Oats Co. , a the maker of 
cereal and sports beverages. 
Enron Energy Services currently manages energy at more than 28,500 customer 
sites.

EPA's Next Challenge: What to Do About Lead Emissions (Update1)

EPA's Next Challenge: What to Do About Lead Emissions (Update1)

     (Adds cost estimates for compliance in ninth paragraph.)

     Washington, March 29 (Bloomberg) -- A coalition representing
mining, coal, chemical and electrical companies has asked U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Christie Whitman to
delay new rules aimed at reducing lead pollution.
     The rules, among dozens issued in the last days of President
Bill Clinton's administration, would require companies that use
more than 100 pounds of lead per year to publicly report any
emissions into the air, water and soil. The right-to-know rules
currently apply only to users of more than 10,000 pounds.
     Among the companies that may be affected by the rules are
Edison International, American Electric Power Co., Barrick Gold
Corp., Enron Corp., and FMC Corp.
     The lobbying effort on lead follows EPA 's decision last week
to block new regulations lowering the permissible level of arsenic
in water, President George W. Bush's decision to abandon the 1997
global warming treaty, and Bush's move to break a campaign promise
to regulate carbon dioxide emissions.
     Environmental groups have criticized those actions and say a
reversal of the lead rule would be another blow to public safety.
     ``We would react to this as a major assault on the public's
right to know,'' said Paul Orum, director of the Working Group on
Community Right-to-Know.
     Whitman has until April 17 to decide.

                          Lobbying Clout

     Seventy-three associations that represent oil refiners,
manufacturers, electrical power producers, mining companies,
battery makers, and lead smelters, said in a March 1 letter to
Whitman that implementation costs for the new lead rules would be
high for small companies and that there are no scientific studies
to prove they are necessary.
     EPA says the combined cost of compliance would be about $80
million the first year and $40 million per year thereafter.
     One of the groups, the IPC, which represents electronics
makers, said it has hired the law firm of King & Spalding to
prepare for a suit to block the new rules.
     The coalition can lay claim to some of Washington's biggest
lobbying operations. ``I don't think it's lost on anybody that
there are 73 associations concerned,'' said Jane Luxton of King &
Spalding.
     The group includes the National Association of Manufacturers,
which spent nearly $1.2 million on lobbying in the last six months
of 1999 alone, the last year for which statistics were available.
according to FECInfo, a group that tracks lobbying and campaign
donations.

                        Campaign Donations

     Members of the coalition gave hundreds of thousands to
Republicans during the 2000 elections.
     The Edison Electric Institute, for example, gave nearly
$194,000 through its political action committee and roughly
$505,000 in ``soft money,'' the unlimited and largely unregulated
cash that flows to political parties. More than half went to
Republicans.
     The Institute spent roughly $7.3 million on in-house and
contract lobbying in the last six months of 1999, hiring Baker &
Botts, the law firm of former Secretary of State James Baker and
other well-known Washington lobbying shops, according to FECInfo.
     The National Mining Association gave $159,00 through it's PAC
and more than $92,000 in soft money, with two thirds going to
Republicans. It spent about $690,000 on lobbying in the same
period.

                         Children at Risk

     A 1986 law gave the EPA authority to set reporting thresholds
for toxic chemicals that persist in the environment and in human
bodies. Lead persists in the environment, and is ingested through
water, and inhalation of paint fumes.
     Scientists have warned about exposure to lead for decades. A
study of 4,800 children conducted between 1988 and 1994 found that
even almost any lead can result in lower math and reading scores.
     ``There does not appear to be any safe level of lead in the
blood'' for children, said Bruce Lanphear, an associate professor
of pediatrics at Children's Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati
who wrote the report, which will be published next month by the
U.S. Public Health Service.
     Much of the research has focused on ingestion of lead paint
by children, the most common form of exposure. About 40 percent of
U.S. homes have lead paint, said Richard Levinson, associate
executive director of the American Public Health Association,
citing government statistics.
     Lead exposure from industrial emissions is less common but
more potent, scientists said. Lead dispersed in the air is
absorbed more by the body than that contained in paint chips,
Lanphear said.

                           Never Leaves

     The body retains lead, mostly in the bones, releasing it into
the bloodstream as a person ages and gets bone diseases such as
osteoporosis.
     ``As you get older, the lead levels get higher,'' said Robert
Wright, a toxicologist and epidemiologist at Harvard Medical
School.
     Recent studies have suggested a link between lead and
hypertension, kidney problems and lower IQ scores among adults,
Wright added.
     Asked about such studies, Jeff Miller, executive director of
the Lead Industries Association, which represents 79 lead-making
producers across the country, said: ``People have to realize that
lead poisoning in the United States today is not a major health
problem,'' Miller said. ``The question really is, `Is it causing a
problem when it's in the bones?' ''
     As governor of New Jersey, Whitman was criticized by
environmental groups for removing more than 1,000 chemicals from
the state's right-to-know list.

riding in her first BP MS 150 in 1994, Alder had to have a private start, 
away from all the masses of cyclists, the next two times she participated in 
the Houston to Austin tour. 
Alder's motto these days, however, is the more the merrier. And Alder spends 
her time doing everything she can to make sure the group she's riding with is 
the largest of them all. 
Alder is the force behind the Enron team that participates each year in the 
MS 150. For the past three years, Enron has fielded not only the largest team 
in the Houston to Austin race, but also the largest team of any of the 130 MS 
150 bike tours taking place across the country. 
More importantly, Enron has also raised the most money of any team in any 
race in the nation. 
""Last year, Enron raised $525,000 for MS, which was the best in the country,"" 
Alder said. ""We are really proud of that. We had 400 riders who really came 
through. At Enron, we see the MS 150 as a bike tour for fund-raisers rather 
than a bike trip for cyclists. And most of our cyclists respond to that."" 
So far this year, with just shy of a month left before the MS 150, Alder said 
Enron already has 400 cyclists signed up to ride. 
""That's where we topped out last year,"" she said. ""So we're expecting to see 
a lot more."" 
Alder started the Enron team in 1996 with 10 people, just two years after her 
injury. It was during the 1994 race that Alder got hit from behind by another 
cyclist. She toppled from her bike and slammed into the ground with such 
force that she doesn't recall anything about the accident or immediately 
following. 
Alder had to have brain surgery and she almost didn't make it. During the 
next year, she would be back in the hospital three or four times for 
complications. 
""I was back in the hospital during the 1995 tour, and I felt so bad that I 
couldn't take part,"" she said. ""So in 1996 I said, `I'm going to make it.' 
And I was just inspired to build a team."" 
By 1997, the Enron team was up to 50 people and raised $50,000. 
""That was when the corporation decided to get on board and support us 
financially,"" Alder said. ""That's when it really took off."" 
In 1998, Enron moved into the top position in the team race and has stayed 
there ever since. With the large number of employees participating, Team 
Enron has become quite a production for Alder to organize. 
""Every rider gets a free team jersey and a free massage when we stop for the 
night in La Grange,"" she said. ""We travel with a team of 30 masseurs and one 
doctor. We also have our own food and a large tent for our sleeping 
accommodations. Even our CEO, Jeff Skilling, rides with us and sleeps in the 
tent and hangs out with the team. He's the real champ of the team."" 
To be eligible to participate in the BP MS 150, an individual must raise $200 
in sponsorships. But to be eligible to join the Enron team, a cyclist must 
raise double that. 
Alder said it takes approximately 50 volunteers to service the team during 
the ride. For a 12-member core team, organizing the ride is a year-round 
project. 
""This year it will be really competitive,"" Alder said. ""There's a couple 
other corporations who are making a real push for that top spot. We hope we 
stay ahead this year. We're hoping to stay in first place. But for the sake 
of the MS Society, we hope the other corporations can do as well as Enron. 
""This is such a sentimental journey for me every year. I love Enron and I'm 
dedicated to the MS Society and this ride also represents a whole new era of 
my life. It's just a great event."" 
Odds and ends -- The BP MS 150 Bike Giveaway is underway at area bike stores. 
Interested parties can stop in at any of the 26 official bike shops in the 
Houston and Austin areas and fill out an entry form. You don't have to be 
participating in the MS 150 to enter. 
At the close of business on April 9, each bike store will randomly draw one 
winner from each store. Additional bikes are also being given away in 
conjunction with promotional contests on FM and AM Clear Channel radio 
stations in Houston. 
Each winner will receive a gift certificate from the National Multiple 
Sclerosis Society in the amount of $325, good toward the purchase of a 
bicycle at an official BP MS 150 store. For information, call the MS Society 
at (713) 526-8967. ... 
Kudos to Gail Hurley for another great job running the Bluebonnet Express 
Metric Century, which took place March 18 in the Hempstead area. Hurley is 
retiring as race director after two years at the helm. This year's ride had 
more than 1,900 cyclists and no major problems.

Enron's Dispute With Indian State Over Power Bills Takes New Turn

BOMBAY, India -- Enron Corp.'s Indian power project has given the state of 
Maharashtra notice amounting to a threat to cut off electricity, raising the 
stakes in a dispute over bills from India's first big private power plant. 
The Enron-controlled Dabhol Power Co. delivered a notice of political force 
majeure to the Indian state, saying recent government actions could harm the 
company's ability to ""perform obligations."" A political force majeure is 
typically used to dissolve a contract after a war, a coup, or a similar 
radical event.
In this case, the declaration may be a pressure tactic, as the state 
government moves to renegotiate a five-year-old contract for the plant's 
second phase. A spokesman for Dabhol, in which Bechtel Group Inc. and General 
Electric Co. are junior shareholders, said yesterday that the notice was an 
effort to protect the $3 billion project's lenders, who ""have expressed 
concern"" about difficulties getting payments. He declined to elaborate. 
The cash-strapped Maharashtra State Electricity Board, Dabhol's only 
customer, has failed to make payments since December. 
The federal government has guaranteed the payments. But the government has 
withheld two months' worth, a total of $48 million, citing a claim against 
the gas-fired plant for taking two hours longer than promised to restart 
after shutdowns. The Dabhol spokesman said the Indian government agreed 
yesterday to send the payment dispute to a mediation panel. 
Vinay Bansal, chairman of the state electricity board, said he disagrees with 
the force majeure declaration. Mr. Bansal said Dabhol's notice pointed to 
recent statements by Maharashtra's top official questioning the need for the 
project's second phase. It also cited pronouncements by the federal 
government that it wouldn't pay until the shutdown dispute is resolved. He 
said the notice cited the state government's creation of a panel to review, 
and possibly renegotiate, the Dabhol contract. The panel is scheduled to 
release its conclusions on Dabhol today. 
The notice from Dabhol didn't say what the power company might do. Cutting 
off power would have limited effect. The board has already reduced purchases 
from Dabhol to a minimum, letting the 740-megawatt plant produce at 30% of 
capacity. The board blames Dabhol's high rates for the reduction, saying it 
must buy from cheaper sources first. Enron says rates would fall if the plant 
produced at 90% capacity, as envisioned when the first-phase contract was 
reached in 1993.

E.ON and Powergen Form a Superpower --- Deal Will Create World's 
Second-Largest Utility --- It Also Marks Europe's First Big Leap Into U.S. 
Market
By Vanessa Fuhrmans and Marc Champion
Staff Reporters

E.ON AG unveiled plans to take over Powergen PLC for 8.2 billion euros in 
cash and assume 7.1 billion euros in debt, a deal that would create the 
world's second-largest electricity-service provider and strike one of the 
boldest moves yet to consolidate Europe's newly deregulated power industry. 
E.ON said it would offer Powergen shareholders 765 pence (12.18 euros) per 
share -- an 8.4% premium to last week's closing share price -- valuing the 
U.K. utility at 8.2 billion euros. In addition, E.ON would take on roughly 
7.1 billion euros in debt from Powergen's acquisition of Kentucky-based LG&E 
Energy Corp.
The deal is the latest in a recent string of mergers and acquisitions to roil 
Europe's energy sector; E.ON itself was formed in late 1999 from the merger 
of German utility giants Veba AG and Viag AG. But the acquisition of Powergen 
would go further, creating the world's second-largest utility, after 
state-owned Electricite de France, in terms of electricity sales volume. It 
also marks the first big leap by a continental European utility into the 
U.S., the world's biggest power market, via LG&E. 
Monday, Powergen shares rose 1.9% in London to 719.5 pence, while E.ON shares 
jumped 5.2% to 54.45 euros in Frankfurt. 
Analysts cautioned that while the deal looks good on paper, carrying it out 
could prove difficult. E.ON still has to find buyers and reasonable prices 
for businesses with a total market value of more than 15 billion euros. And 
expanding in the U.S., where prices for utilities are on the rise and the 
regulatory environment is tough, also won't be easy. 
""It will be very easy to get their fingers burned,"" said Peter Atherton, 
analyst at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney. ""This is a deal that makes sense, 
but it carries a large execution risk."" 
The Kentucky utility, LG&E, is only the first step in E.ON's broader U.S. 
expansion plans, E.ON Chief Executive Ulrich Hartmann said. The German power 
giant will have a war chest of between 30 billion euros and 45 billion euros, 
depending how quickly it sells some of its nonenergy businesses. Much of it, 
Mr. Hartmann said, would go toward spreading further into more industrialized 
parts of the Midwest, which makes up one-third of the U.S. electricity 
market. 
""Our goal is to achieve a leading position in the United States,"" said Mr. 
Hartmann, who will remain chief executive of the enlarged E.ON and become 
chairman of Powergen. Powergen Chief Executive Nick Baldwin will continue to 
lead the U.K. utility as a unit of E.ON. 
The deal also will step up E.ON's plans to shed other assets, including major 
subsidiaries such as Degussa AG, a specialty chemicals maker, logistics 
company Stinnes AG, and real estate unit Viterra. 
E.ON and Powergen first disclosed they were in advanced takeover talks nearly 
four months ago. But negotiations snagged on concerns that the acquisition 
would run afoul of strict ownership laws in the U.S. that allow only 
utilities to operate other utilities. Authorities have instead viewed E.ON -- 
which derives half of its market capitalization from activities such as oil, 
chemicals and even electronics -- as a conglomerate. 
E.ON already plans to sell some of those businesses as part of a wider 
restructuring. On Monday, Mr. Hartmann pledged to sell all of them within the 
next three to five years. E.ON plans to make a formal offer for Powergen 
early next year, once it obtains all the regulatory approvals in the U.S., 
U.K. and European Union, and complete the deal by the spring of 2002. 
Like other European utilities, E.ON has been prowling for new acquisitions 
abroad as growing competition and lower electricity prices have cut into 
revenues in its home market. Acquiring Powergen would give E.ON instant 
access to two markets that present more near-term opportunities than 
elsewhere in Europe. Prices being asked for companies in Spain were far too 
high, Mr. Hartmann said, while in France and Italy there were big hurdles for 
purchasers. 
The U.S., by contrast, offers ""a market with greater growth than in Europe 
and an energy market that is very fragmented with a lot of opportunity for 
consolidation,"" he said. 
E.ON and other European utilities also have been eager to expand into the 
U.S. to tap into its lucrative energy trading market particularly as U.S. 
utilities, such as Enron Corp. and Duke Energy Corp., make further inroads 
into Europe's fledgling trading market with their homegrown expertise. 
With Powergen, E.ON will have a utility whose management has 10 years of 
experience competing in a deregulated market and negotiating in the U.S. By 
comparison, the German market embarked on deregulation only three years ago. 
Powergen has been narrowing its generation business in recent years as it 
moved to develop an integrated energy business that includes generation, 
distribution, retail services and trading. Two years ago, for example, 
Powergen owned over 20% of the U.K.'s generating capacity. It now has 10%, 
comprised of seven mainly gas- and coal-fired plants but has expanded in the 
retail sector, adding one million customers last year.

American Airlines became the world's largest air carrier after acquiring the 
assets of bankrupt Trans World Airlines. The deal was completed after a 
federal appeals court denied a last-minute bid by a group of Israeli TWA 
workers to stop financially troubled TWA from selling its assets to American 
Airlines' parent company, AMR. AMR's deal to pay $742 million for the 
airline, plus the assumption of $3.5 billion in debt, does not include funds 
for TWA's unsecured creditors. The Israeli workers are unsecured creditors 
owed about $18 million in salaries and benefits, their attorney said.

American Airlines, meanwhile, said it will charge passengers $10 each for 
paper tickets if a customer qualifies for an electronic ticket, as the 
carrier tries to reduce costs. The fee will be levied for tickets on American 
and American Eagle bought at the AA.com Web site; American's reservations 
centers; its Travel Centers, which are outside airports; and airports. 
American wouldn't say how it decides who qualifies for an e-ticket. 
Bank One has agreed to purchase Wachovia's $8 billion portfolio of consumer 
credit cards for undisclosed terms. The acquisition is the first for 
Chicago-based Bank One since Jamie Dimon became chief executive last March.

INDIA: India govt says to seek conciliation with Enron.

04/10/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW DELHI, April 10 (Reuters) - India said on Tuesday that it planned to seek 
conciliation with U.S. energy giant Enron after the company invoked political 
force majeure over its controversy-ridden power project in western India. 
""We have agreed to conciliation and we will go ahead with conciliation,"" 
Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha told reporters on the sidelines of a textiles 
conference. He did not elaborate.
The Indian unit of Enron , Dabhol Power Company (DPC), sent the force majeure 
notice on Monday to state utility Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). 
The notice was the latest step in a running confrontation between the U.S. 
multinational and the Maharashtra government over unpaid bills. 
Last week, Houston-based Enron notified the government it was applying to an 
arbitration court in London to consider its claim for 1.02 billion rupees 
owed by MSEB for power it purchased in December from DPC. Enron owns 65 
percent of DPC.

India: Finance minister on telecom, textiles policy, Enron issue

04/10/2001
BBC Monitoring

Monitoring/(c) BBC

Excerpt from report by Indian news agency PTI 
New Delhi, 10 April: Indian Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha on Tuesday [10 
April] said there was no rethinking on the part of Federal Government over 
its telecom policy, but the issue of providing limited area mobile telephone 
through wireless local loop system was being reviewed by the Group of 
Ministers on Telecom.
""Government is not having any rethinking. The issue is being reviewed by a 
group on telecom and IT. We will soon have a meeting of the group to look at 
the policy and make recommendations to the government"", Sinha told reporters 
on the sidelines of a conference of state textile ministers in the Indian 
capital city. 
Asked about federal Communication Minister Ram Vilas Paswan's statement that 
the 1999 telecom policy would be modified to enable introduction of Wireless 
Local Loop (WLL), Sinha said Paswan is a member of the group and it will 
listen to what he has to say. 
""I cannot anticipate the conclusions of the group. The one lesson I have 
learnt is not to react to newspaper reports which are appearing,"" he said. 
On the dispute over Enron's Dabhol power project, Sinha said, Indian 
government has decided to resolve the issue through conciliation. 
""We have agreed to conciliation and we will go ahead with conciliation,"" 
Sinha said. 
The Dabhol power company had slapped arbitration and conciliation notices on 
federal finance ministry for not settling dues totalling 1.02bn rupees for 
December. 
Sinha's observation came after a meeting of senior officials of federal 
finance and power ministry on Monday which decided to adopt the conciliation 
route rather than arbitration to settle the standoff. 
On the demand of the textile sector to review the 16 per cent excise duty 
imposed on branded garments, Sinha said, he would not like to go into the 
specific taxation proposals now as they were the property of parliament. 
But at the same time, he admitted there were some areas of concern in the 
textile sector which merited reconsideration in consultation with the textile 
ministry. 
On the loss making National Textile Corporation, Sinha said the government 
was ""trying its best to revive as many mills as possible within our means"". 
The Group of Ministers on NTC had already gone into the issue and had come 
out with some recommendations which would be sent to the cabinet for taking a 
final view, he said. 
Sinha said the government had a very positive approach on the issue. 
Earlier addressing the state textiles ministers conference, Sinha cautioned 
the textiles industry against raising the bogey of dumping and said there was 
no escape from fair competition within the WTO regime. 
""We have to prepare ourselves for fair competition, through modernization, 
upgradation of technology and adoption of good management practices on a 
continuous basis."" 
Sinha, however, said government would take all steps to ensure there was no 
unfair competition through enforcement of anti-dumping regulations and tariff 
measures. 
He said the dismantling of Multi-Fibre Agreement by December 2004 offered 
both opportunity and challenges. ""If we do not prepare for it we will end up 
on the losing side""...

India: 'Failed business model' for Dabhol

04/10/2001
Business Line (The Hindu)
Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) - 
Asia Intelligence Wire

MUMBAI, April 9. EVEN as the wrangling continues over the Dabhol power 
project, financial analysts, in consultation with legal experts, are trying 
to identify means by which the feuding parties can back off after cutting 
their losses. 
One proposal that has been put forward is by Mr Pradyumna Kaul, management 
consultant and anti-Enron activist. Mr Kaul has suggested that the project be 
treated as a ""failed business model"". In other words, a sick company.
In his deposition before the Godbole Committee, set up to examine the Enron 
issue, Mr Kaul examined various alternatives available, and homed in on the 
""open market"" method. The model suggests restructuring the project in 
consultation with lenders, as the ""minority shareholders have developed 
serious differences with the majority stakeholders"". 
Mr Kaul has argued that Dabhol Power Company (DPC) must not be allowed 
third-party sale of power (as suggested by it as a possible solution) as that 
would wean away the high-paying customers of the Maharashtra State 
Electricity Board, paving the way for its bankruptcy. 
""A Greenwich University report speaks about 8-10 ways adopted by different 
countries for cancelling IPP contracts. The most common one is a legislative 
fiat - Parliament or a State Assembly pass a law declaring the project 
illegal ab initio, and, therefore, void ab initio. No rights would accrue to 
any of the parties involved in the contract,"" he told the panel. 
He cited the example of Pakistan which cancelled six projects already 
producing power at one stroke through this route and the nation ""remained 
unaffected"". 
A ""workable private sector cure"", according to Mr Kaul, would be to reduce 
the ""over-invoiced"" capital cost. The share capital, by way of illustration, 
can be written down from Rs 10 to Re 1. This has happened in Far East Asia, 
he said. To deal with the debt, loans have to be restructured and interest 
deferred. 
The capital cost of phase I of the Dabhol project is around Rs 3,760 crore, 
comprising 30 per cent (about Rs 1,100 crore) equity and the rest debt 
(around Rs 2,600 crore). ""The equity has to be written down by a factor of 10 
to about Rs 100 crore and the debt has to be brought down by half. The 
interest has to be deferred,"" Mr Kaul suggested. 
This depends on the Government and MSEB playing a major role.

State seeks more power from Central Grid
The Times of India News Service

04/10/2001
The Times of India
Copyright (C) 2001 The Times of India; Source: World Reporter (TM)

BANGALORE: The state government has urged the Centre to provide an additional 
14 million units (MU) of power from the Central Grid to tide over the present 
shortfall in demand. 
Speaking to reporters here on Monday, Energy Minister Veerakumar Patil said 
KPTC chairman V.P. Baligar was in Delhi for talks with the Union Power 
Ministry and had put forth this request.
``The state generates 57.244 MU and is supplemented with 24.260 MU from the 
grid while the demand is around 95 MU leading to a shortfall of roughly 14 
MU,'' he stated. 
Patil said the government had held discussions with Enron of Maharashtra for 
supply of power but dropped the proposal since it was an expensive affair at 
Rs 4.60 per unit. ``We did ask them to reconsider the pricing but they have 
not responded so far,'' he said. 
Meanwhile, the state was also getting ready to implement a programme for 
proper distribution of the available power within a week. ``Irrigation 
pumpsets will get three-phase power only at night, while supply will also be 
suitably regulated for non urban users as well. As of now we have no urban 
loadshedding proposal,'' he declared. 
As for eight-hour uninterrupted power supply for farmers from May 1 as 
announced by Chief Minister S.M. Krishna in his budget speech, Patil felt the 
state would be ready to fulfil the promise. ``We expect demand to fall by May 
enabling us to provide this amount. We are chalking out a detailed programme 
to achieve this,'' he informed. 
Referring to the Raichur Thermal Power Station, he said the third unit had 
started functioning about 10 days ago, while the fifth would commence on May 
15. ``Work on the seventh unit is in full swing and is ahead of schedule by 
28 days,'' he said. 
Asked about arrears, Patil said the KPTC had no outstanding dues to

Houston Chronicle
Board picks California firm to build and run water plant 
By MARY FLOOD 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
A Pasadena, Calif., engineering firm was chosen Monday by a citizens board 
that will now negotiate a design-build-operate contract for a Lake Houston 
water plant that could cost as much as $150 million. 
The Houston Area Water Corp. board, known as the Hawk, voted 4-1 to negotiate 
a contract with Montgomery Watson Inc. despite three recommendations from 
City Hall staff that it choose another bidder. City Hall favored 
Houston-based Azurix Corp., a troubled affiliate of Enron Corp. 
After a contract is worked out, it will be presented to the City Council for 
approval, but the council does not have to accept the board's recommendation. 
Azurix was the rumored front-runner for months. Evidence that Mayor Lee 
Brown's administration wanted Azurix to get the contract came when City 
Attorney Anthony Hall had a heated public argument with the Hawk's chairman, 
David Berg, at a mayoral fund-raiser last month. They discussed an attempt by 
City Hall staff to change its calculation to favor Montgomery Watson. 
The staff was told by Hall and the mayor's chief administrative officer that 
such a change would taint the decision process and that the staff should 
support Azurix. The Hawk was not bound by the staff recommendation. 
""There was no pressure from City Hall that I and the board could not 
withstand,"" Berg said. He also joked when a reporter's cell phone rang 
midmeeting, ""If that's Anthony Hall, tell him our anger management class is 
at 3:30."" 
The plant is part of a Houston-area surface-water treatment and use plan that 
could cost about $2 billion to implement. Montgomery Watson's bid came in 
around $17 million below Azurix's. The third bidder is U.S. Filter Operating 
Services, part of a French company. 
""Montgomery Watson is, frankly, cheaper. And that's impressive to me,"" Berg 
said. He also told the anxious crowd of business people at the meeting that 
he went against the City Hall staff's recommendation in part because of the 
financial viability of the three companies and Azurix's announcement Friday 
that it plans to sell Azurix North America, the body that would oversee this 
contract. 
""We are disappointed with the decision the Hawk made,"" said Diane Bazelides, 
spokeswoman for Azurix. 
Board member Andy DeAnda, an engineer, was the sole voter for Azurix, though 
a sixth board member, Binh Ho, was absent but had indicated he, too, would 
have voted for Azurix. ""I wanted to respect the staff recommendation,"" DeAnda 
said. ""Plus companies are bought and sold all the time. That doesn't bother 
me."" 
Kathi Wilkes, a lobbyist for Montgomery Watson, said it was happy to get the 
board's nod and doesn't really know what pressure City Council will get from 
the other companies. 
City Councilman Carroll Robinson, who heads the council's infrastructure 
committee that will hear from the Hawk board, said the council will now ask 
questions of the board and staff and decide if the right decision was made. 
""I don't think everybody's going to walk away. I assume (all three companies) 
will still want to make their case to council about why they should have been 
picked,"" he said. 
Berg will make a preliminary report to Robinson's committee today. 
""This has been a very long process, longer than we thought,"" said Berg. ""I 
recall (the mayor's chief administrative officer) saying to us it'll be six 
months, six meetings and it'll be over, no big deal."" 
The board, appointed almost eight months ago, has instead been a center of 
controversy. Legislators have questioned the wisdom of allowing local 
government corporations like the Hawk to handle such large projects. The 
board is allowed by state law to choose a design-build-operate contract 
winner without following the traditional bidding process. 
There has also been some friction over the Hawk with Harris County and 
regional water boards about how the city of Houston will provide surface 
water and how much it will cost. 




		

		
		

		
		ASIA-PACIFIC, AFRICA & MIDDLE EAST: Enron threat to withdraw from India 
Financial Times; Apr 10, 2001
By DAVID GARDNER and KHOZEM MERCHANT

		Enron, the US-based power company, yesterday delivered a warning that it 
could withdraw from a controversial Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2.1bn) power project 
in India, where it is locked in a payments dispute with a Bombay utility. 
		Officials at the Houston-based company said last night that it had lost 
confidence in the state company that is contractually obliged to buy the 
output of its Maharashtra plant. 
		Enron's 2,364MW plant at Dabhol, Maharashtra is the biggest foreign 
investment in India and the only one of eight fast-track power projects 
unveiled in the early 1990s to be up and running. Enron's departure would be 
damaging to the government, which held up the sector as a standard-bearer of 
liberalisation, only to see entrants scared off by red tape. Cogentrix of the 
US quit in December 1999 after waiting seven years for approval of its 
project. 
		Enron yesterday issued a ""political force majeure"" notice to the Maharashtra 
State Electricity Board (MSEB), a standard contractual clause that aggrieved 
parties use as a first step towards possibly quitting. Companies issue the 
notice if they believe circumstances on the ground have undermined a 
contract. 
		Enron is owed Rs2.25bn (Pounds 33m) in unpaid bills by MSEB, which recently 
raised the stakes by imposing a Rs4.02bn penalty on the company for 
""technical under-performance"". Enron has called in two federal government 
guarantees on the unpaid bills. Enron said ""the concerted, deliberate and 
politically motivated action of the government of Maharashtra, government of 
India and MSEB have or potentially will have a material and adverse effect 
(on the company's) ability to perform obligations under the power purchase 
agreement"". 
		Vinay Bansal, chairman of MSEB, said Enron's notice ""does not seek particular 
relief so it is unclear what is their intention"". But he said MSEB would 
press ahead with its claim for Rs4.02bn for ""services that we have a right to 
expect"". Enron has dismissed the claim as ""frivolous and a diversion"". 
		Power industry sources in New Delhi said the effect of Enron's move yesterday 
could be to raise the stakes in its struggle to get paid by MSEB, or to 
signal its intention to withdraw from India. 
		One power industry executive noted, however, that Enron, as part of its 
world-wide strategy, has begun moving out of the ownership of assets into the 
trading of power, although investment in assets is often part of the entry 
strategy to build the trading relationship. ""The question is whether Enron is 
willing to write India off,"" he said. ""Or, rather, will they get rid of the 
assets before the trading strategy has had time to get going."" For regional

EFET To Set Up Belgian Electricity Task Force

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The European Federation of Energy Traders said Tuesday 
that it is forming a task force to look into the Belgian electricity market. 
""A number of our members have raised concerns about the trading environment 
in Belgium. This will be examined by the new task force,"" an EFET spokesman 
said.
The Belgian Task Force Electricity will include, among others, 
representatives from TXU Corp. (TXU), RWE Trading, Enron Europe (U.ENE), 
Eneco and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter (MWD) as well as and an energy 
specialist from the academic sphere. One or two Spanish players may also join 
the group. 
The task force is scheduled to hold its first meeting on May 19, a 
politically sensitive time for Belgium, as it is due to take over the E.U.'s 
rotating presidency from Sweden in June. 
The European Electricity Directive requires member states to have opened up 
at least 26.5% of their electricity markets by 1999. However, according to 
industry groups only 5% of the Belgian market is presently open to 
competition. 
EFET, which has 47 European energy trading companies among its members, has 
already set up a task force to look into the French power market - French 
Task Force Electricity - and a similar group to look at the German gas market 
- German Task Force Gas.

GERMANY: DB Energie says German power trade in too few hands.
By Vera Eckert

04/10/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

FRANKFURT, April 10 (Reuters) - DB Energie GmbH, the power supply division of 
German railways, said on Tuesday it was worried by a concentration of power 
trading in too few hands. 
Consolidation at the generation level had resulted in a trade oligopoly which 
only speedier market liberalisation across Europe could help overcome, said 
DB Energie, the leading power consumer accounting for three percent of the 
German total.
""Four big power companies are too few to guarantee competition,"" DB Energie 
spokesman Andreas P. Meyer said. 
""A few players can tighten supplies artificially, thus boosting prices, while 
there are high entry barriers for newcomers,"" he told Reuters. 
""As large consumers we want the harmonisation process in the EU to gather 
speed so that we can choose from a host of suppliers who are competing with 
each other."" 
Since liberalisation two years ago, when German utilities rediscovered their 
customers and wooed them with price cuts, there has been a strong 
consolidation process, leaving most of the power generation market to three 
large companies. 
These are RWE , E.ON , EnBW . 
A fourth company is emerging in the country's east under the leadership of 
Hamburg utility HEW , backed by its Swedish majority owner Vattenfall . 
The formerly separate trading arms of the newly merged companies such as 
VEW/RWE are now operating under one roof. 
The entry of new players such as U.S. firm Enron and brokerage start-ups has 
not dented the position of the big four. 
CONSUMERS LACK CHOICE OF INDEPENDENT SELLERS 
""The distribution divisions of the big players have become the mouthpieces of 
their trading divisions with little room for manoeuvre - it's definitely not 
a buyers' market,"" Meyer said. 
He also said that railway operator Deutsche Bahn AG which paid 2.8 billion 
marks for its energy needs last year was burdened by high energy-related 
taxes. 
The tax bill on energy supplied by the DB Energie subsidiary to the parent 
company last year amounted to 620 million marks, but was seen rising to 900 
million by the year 2005. 
This was attributed to four taxes - the eco-tax on fuel use, the KWK law 
subsidising combined heat and power, the EEG law supporting renewable 
energies and the mineral oil tax. 
DB Energie's turnover last year of 2.2 billion marks did not exclusively 
represent energy purchases on behalf of Deutsche Bahn, but also reflected the 
growing third party business including portfolio management services, Meyer 
said. 
At the same time, Deutsche Bahn also bought some electricity, diesel oil, 
water, gas and heat from sources other than its own multi-utility subsidiary. 
Meyer said DB Energie had set itself ambitious growth and profit targets for 
the coming years. 
Of the 15 terawatt hours (TWh) purchases handled last year, which are 
projected to rise to 17.3 TWh in 2001, some 2 TWh were on behalf of external 
energy consumers. 
Meyer said he expected that the 2 TWh could increase fivefold by 2004, due to 
the expansion of traffic volumes and the rise of private freight forwarding 
companies. 
His firm also aimed to help Deutsche Bahn save 100 million marks a year 
through efficient usage of the entire supply chain. 
But it wanted to be a buying and portfolio specialist - it would not become a 
classical power trader in its own right.

INDIA: INTERVIEW-India says Enron issue won't affect investment.
By Unni Krishnan

04/10/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW DELHI, April 10 (Reuters) - Indian Power Minister Suresh Prabhu said on 
Tuesday a row over U.S. energy giant Enron's controversy-ridden project in 
western India would not affect foreign investment in the power sector. 
The long-running quarrel between Enron's Indian unit, Dabhol Power Co (DPC), 
and the Maharashtra state government heated up on Monday when DPC sent a 
political force majeure notice to state utility Maharashtra State Electricity 
Board (MSEB).
Political force majeure is any event beyond the reasonable control of an 
affected party that could not have been prevented by good practice. It forms 
a part of major financial contracts. 
""Enron is not the symbol of the power sector in India. I want to assure the 
international investor that we are for FDI (foreign direct investment). But a 
commercial dispute should not be viewed as a reflection on FDI inflows,"" 
Prabhu told Reuters. 
India, which is gripped by a severe power crisis with close to 80,000 
villages without electricity, began power reforms in the early 1990s to 
attract private and foreign investment in the sector to meet the hunger for 
electricity. 
But many foreign power firms including Cogentrix of the United States, 
Electricite De France and Daewoo of South Korea have pulled out of different 
projects following disputes over pricing and the slow pace of reforms in the 
sector. 
SPARRING MATCH 
Enron and the Indian government have been sparring for the past few months 
over MSEB's repeated default on payments owed to Dabhol Power Co which is 65 
percent owned by Houston-based Enron. 
Last week, DPC sent an arbitration notice to the federal government to try to 
recover 1.02 billion rupees due from the state utility. 
Prabhu said the dispute was purely commercial and that many countries were 
interested in getting involved in India's power sector. 
""So many companies are coming. We are signing MoUs (memorandums of 
understanding) with Norway, Sweden and Canada for development of power 
projects,"" he told Reuters. ""So where is the question of FDI (foreign direct 
investment) getting affected?"" 
He said the government would seek conciliation with Enron and planned to 
start negotiations soon. ""We will mutually agree and decide."" 
He said the focus of India's power reforms was on revamping distribution and 
drawing foreign direct investment in this area. 
He said the government was keen on increasing capacity by 100,000 megawatts 
by 2012 by revamping distribution, modernisation of existing plants and 
greenfield projects. 
India had an installed capacity of 96,950 megawatts as of March 31, 2000. It 
needs another 100,000 megawatts in the next 10 years. 
But potential investors have been deterred by the poor finances of state 
electricity boards which are expected to run up combined losses of 285.45 
billion rupees in 2001/02 due to mismanagement and theft in power 
distribution. 
On the generation side, Prabhu said the government was planning to set up 
joint ventures with the domestic private sector for nuclear power. 
""We are looking at this. The (state-run) Power Finance Corporation is looking 
at the possibility of creating joint ventures,"" he added.

Saudi Gas Committee Submits Proj Leader Proposal-Sources
By Dyala Sabbagh
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

DUBAI --(Dow Jones)- The Saudi Arabian committee negotiating with 
international oil companies on gas projects on offer in the kingdom has 
submitted its proposals for consortium leaders for the three core ventures to 
the Supreme Petroleum Council for approval, sources familiar with the process 
told Dow Jones Newswires Tuesday. 
Once approved, other consortium members will be selected followed by 
memoranda of understanding, expected sometime in May, the sources said.
Final approval will also be required from the kingdom's Supreme Economic 
Council, headed by Crown Prince Abdullah, the sources added. 
Consortium leaders will be responsible for directing further detailed 
negotiations on the core projects such as pricing and finance, on behalf of 
those companies selected for each project. The current shortlist of 10 
companies hoping to get a piece of the pie may be trimmed once leaders are 
officially approved. ExxonMobil Seen As Fronrunner For $15B South Ghawar 
Project 

Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD), BP Amoco PLC (BP), ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron 
(CHV), TotalFinaElf (TOT) and ENI SpA (E) have been shortlisted for core 
venture number one, the $15-billion South Ghawar Area Development. Although 
Exxon, Shell and BP have all been dubbed as frontrunners, ExxonMobil is 
thought to have the strongest chance of selection, the sources said. 
ExxonMobil has been present in Saudi Arabia since the 1960s and is one of the 
largest foreign direct investors in the kingdom, with three existing refining 
joint ventures. The company is also Saudi national oil company Saudi Aramco's 
largest crude oil customer. 
For core venture two, the Red Sea Development, Enron Corp. (ENE) and 
Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) are bidding jointly and ExxonMobil, 
TotalfinaElf, Marathon Oil Canada Inc. (T.M), Shell and Conoco Inc. (COCA) 
have also been listed. Among these, Total and Shell have been dubbed as 
strong possibilities, the sources said. 
For core venture three, the Shaybah area, TotalFinaElf, Conoco, Phillips 
Petroleum (P), Enron & Occidental, ExxonMobil, Shell and Marathon Oil have 
been listed. Conoco and TotalfinaElf are seen as the frontrunners on this. 
Each core project has on average six to ten individual components and the 
three have a combined investment value of about $25 billion. 
As well as getting operatorship of the projects, consortium leaders are 
likely to get the largest stake in any project. 
Saudi Arabia invited international oil companies to invest in its downstream 
gas sector and upstream gas enhancement over two years ago in an attempt to 
meet an estimated demand of 14 billion cubic feet a day of gas by 2025. 
Currently, there is about 2.5 bcf/day in the kingdom's gas system.

Online Energy Trading Will Exceed $3.6 Trillion By 2005, According To 
Forrester Research

04/10/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 10, 2001--Despite a tumultuous 
environment created by rising energy prices and new laws and regulations, 
online energy trading in wholesale markets surged 750% from 1999 to 2000. 
According to a new Report by Forrester Research, Inc. (Nasdaq: FORR), online 
energy trading will continue this rapid growth -- leaping from $400 billion 
in 2000 to $3.6 trillion in 2005. Three-quarters of this volume will come 
from the rollout of new over-the-counter financial derivatives like swaps and 
spreads. 
""Despite last year's turbulence, energy companies jumped on the Net 
bandwagon, investing in dot-com trading sites, building private eCommerce 
platforms, and forming industry consortia,"" said Jim Walker, senior analyst 
at Forrester. ""While Enron dominated online trade in 2000, new industry 
consortia like TradeSpark and IntercontinentalExchange are ramping up volume 
-- increasing liquidity for the entire market.""
As energy companies adopt the Net, their trading style will change from art 
to science. In this environment, companies will supplement person-to-person 
negotiated deals with quantitative analysis and program trading. The speed 
and efficiency of online trade will also push traders to develop 
straight-through processing from order capture to contract settlement -- 
enabling companies to post real-time P&Ls in this highly volatile market. 
Rather than giving rise to a plethora of new venues, the majority of online 
trading will occur at only a few sites. By 2005, three distinct venues will 
form to serve different markets: one liquidity hub, three merchant platforms, 
and thirty solution sites. The liquidity hub will attract companies seeking 
to exchange price risk in pure commodities. Merchant platforms will offer 
industry marketmakers a venue for trading products to maximize margins from 
their own long-term assets and customer contracts. Finally, energy companies 
will offer branded solution sites to structure special deals and provide 
customized services for their wholesale customers. 
""We expect enymex to win out as the liquidity hub, leveraging the strength of 
its offline trading infrastructure and institutional trading community,"" 
added Walker. ""The leaders of the merchant hubs will be Enron, ICE, and 
TradeSpark -- supported by traders willing to make markets and act as 
specialists for specific products."" 
For the Report ""Net Energy Hits Hypergrowth,"" Forrester spoke with executives 
from online energy marketplaces, energy producers, industrial customers, 
traders, and software suppliers.

Indian Govt, Enron Set Up Committee to Resolve Tariff Dispute
2001-04-10 09:32 (New York)


     Mumbai, April 10 (Bloomberg) -- India and the local unit of
Enron Corp., the world's largest energy trader, will set up a
committee to try and settle a dispute over unpaid electricity
bills, company spokesman Jimmy Mogal said.
     Dabhol Power Co., 65 percent owned by Enron, yesterday
invoked `political force majeure' which allows it to stop selling
power to Maharashtra state without being penalized.
     The three-member panel will include one person each nominated
by Dabhol Power and the Indian government, said Mogal. The third
member will be chosen by these two, he said.
     The case will go to international arbitration if the panel
fails to arrive at a solution, Mogal said.
     The Maharashtra State Electricity Board, or MSEB, Dabhol
Power's only customer, hasn't paid the December 2000 bill of 1.02
billion rupees ($22 million) and the January bill of 1.27 billion
rupees, saying they were too high.
     The defaults have forced Dabhol Power to invoke payment
guarantees by India's federal and Maharashtra state government,
where its plant is located.
     That forced the government today to agree to conciliation,
Agence France Presse reported today, citing India's Finance
Minister Yashwant Sinha.
     Enron's $3 billion power, 740 megawatt-a-year project, is the
biggest foreign investment in India. The project faced numerous
delays and at one point was canceled after a change of government
at the state. Enron revived it after agreeing to cut power prices
by 22 percent and sell a 30 percent stake to the state government.

Qatar Says Foreign Oil Companies May Invest $15 Billion by 2005
2001-04-10 09:57 (New York)


     Doha, Qatar, April 10 (Bloomberg) -- Qatar, which holds the
world's third-largest reserves of natural gas, said foreign
companies may invest as much as $15 billion into the Gulf state's
energy industry over the next five years.
     ``A major chunk of this is expected to come from the U.S.,''
said Qatar's finance minister, Youssef Hussein Kamal, who spoke at
an investment conference in Doha attended by a delegation from the
U.S. Congress. ``Qatar offers foreign investors security and
political stability.''
     Dolphin Energy Ltd., a venture of the Abu Dhabi government,
Total Fina Elf SA and Enron Corp., signed an accord with Qatar
last month to buy more than $2 billion in natural gas a year.
Dolphin would develop Qatar's North Dome field, the world's
largest natural gas field, and build a pipeline under the Gulf to
the United Arab Emirates and Oman.
     The gas may be used to power industrial development. A
collapse in oil prices in 1998 reinforced the need for Gulf states
to cut their dependence on crude oil sales and create jobs for the
more than 50 percent of the population that is under the age of
25.
     Qatar is the smallest oil producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.",T-0013

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

Yes they do need to get approval from Southern Pacific Bank.  Their attorney
says that the bank has not responded to their requests.  Pauline is still
trying to get them to move forward.

I spoke with their attorney this AM, and he said that he is reviewing the
settlement document and will like to get everything settled before he leaves
on vacation. (even though he has had the document for a month?)

I suggested that he talk to Jacques to speed the process up.  Pauline may
have been slowing the process by not giving him info.

You should probably have Jacques speak with their attorney (Kolb) if he does
not make contact by tomorrow.

Also, Pauline wants to know if you have any info. on a contact name for the
pay phone.

Call me if you need anything.

GENERAL DEPARTMENT MESSAGE ANNOUNCING THE PAPER TIMESHEET TRANSITION TO ONLINE APPROVAL:
 
If you approve timesheets for Enron Temporary Workers in the administrative/clerical area, this message is for you:
 
Contingent Staffing Solutions (CSS), which provides centralized management for Enron's temporary staffing providers and temporary workers, announces the transition from paper timesheets to online timekeeping.
 
In our ongoing effort to provide greater efficiency and order accuracy to users of Enron Temporary Workers, a temporary worker for whom you must approve time will now enter time online through GRi, the CSS online application that tracks and reports temporary staffing usage.  Once a temporary worker submits his or her time, e-mail is generated that is sent to you, the approver, prompting you to log onto GRi to review the electronic timesheet. 
 
Your logon is:   DonBaughman              
Password is:     DBaughman      
Organization ID is:    2160                                
 
You will be prompted to change your password. 
 
During the transition period, you may have some temporary workers using paper timesheets and some using GRi.  Soon, all paper timesheets will be phased out and all admin/clerical temporaries will report time using only GRi. 
 
We appreciate your cooperation and welcome your feedback during this transition.  You will receive online approval instructions at the time of the order.  Please contact Gwen Chavis/Craig McGee/Liz LeGros at 713-345-6899 if you have any questions.
Please find attached training for order entry and time sheet approval.

On Wednesday we will be having a mini Trading Track interview session.  The quality may not resemble the first session we had but I thought it would be worth it if we can find a couple more folks to put in the program.  We will probably have a much bigger one later in the year after the new analysts and associates join.  I had a couple of observations from last time.

1.  I think we were too hard on external candidates.  There are 5 or 6 external candidates.  Remember that they don't have the Enron grounding that the internal candidates have.  Most of them are not in the Gas or Electricity industry.  Try to evaluate them on their intrinsic qualities.

2.  Some people have not thought about trading concepts and are unfamiliar with trading lingo.  That doesn't mean that they will not be good traders one day. I think we were a little biased based on someones ability to run a stack tommorrow.

John, Bill and Randy will fly into Flagstaff, sometime in the PM of Monday, 
June 18th.  Rich, Tiny and or  I will either pick them up at the airport or 
there is shuttle service to Little America, the hotel in Flagstaff for the 2 
night stay.  We plan on visiting stations 3 and 4 on Tuesday.  Then 1 and 2 
on Wednesday.  I dont think that we will need rental cars as Rich, Tiny and I 
will have our company cars.  John had indicated that he needed to make a 
Thursday meeting in Houston, so I only made reservations at Little America 
for Monday and Tuesday night.  Should Randy and or Bill decide to stay over 
on Thursday, we can make reservations for Wednesday also.  Let me know.   I m 
not sure what Louie is doing, he had stated that he would take care of his 
accomodations should he decide to make the trip.   Ive  got business at 
Stations 1 and 2 on Thursday and Friday, so Ill be there the whole week.  As 
for Tiny, Im sure he will be carrying Rich's luggage any where Rich needs to 
go...... Sarita, what else?

While it would benefit the organization for me to go on this trip,  I don't 
think it is wise to participate given the current project load.

Thanks, Bill

Sarita, were all set for rooms and meals.  The itinerary is as follows.  
John, Bill and Randy will fly into Flagstaff, sometime in the PM of Monday, 
June 18th.  Rich, Tiny and or  I will either pick them up at the airport or 
there is shuttle service to Little America, the hotel in Flagstaff for the 2 
night stay.  We plan on visiting stations 3 and 4 on Tuesday.  Then 1 and 2 
on Wednesday.  I dont think that we will need rental cars as Rich, Tiny and I 
will have our company cars.  John had indicated that he needed to make a 
Thursday meeting in Houston, so I only made reservations at Little America 
for Monday and Tuesday night.  Should Randy and or Bill decide to stay over 
on Thursday, we can make reservations for Wednesday also.  Let me know.   I m 
not sure what Louie is doing, he had stated that he would take care of his 
accomodations should he decide to make the trip.   Ive  got business at 
Stations 1 and 2 on Thursday and Friday, so Ill be there the whole week.  As 
for Tiny, Im sure he will be carrying Rich's luggage any where Rich needs to 
go...... Sarita, what else?

This deal is the same as all the others Carla Hoffman entered yesterday - in 
the interest of time, she entered all deals with a Saturday-Sunday mask in 
Deal Blotter. If the deals were on peak, she said it shouldn't matter that 
they were marked to flow both days, because Sunday is all off-peak hours. I 
explained this in a couple e-mails yesterday - I guess I got confused about 
who I told. Carla said she's done this before and it shouldn't be a problem. 
Please let me know if you agree with this. In my opinion, just taking the 
time to explain the discrepancy in the 10 or 12 deals that were entered this 
way actually took more time than it saved. What do you think?

se=20
revenues to effectively allocate net augmentation costs between Slice and=

in the calculation of the Slice Rate, which was determined in BPA's Record =
of=20
Decision published in May 2000, or (b) the approach to this issue proposed =
by=20
BPA in the December 2000 Amended Proposal.""



response_text:  First, regarding the specific requests contained in this da=
ta=20
request, neither the ROD in May 2000 nor the December 2000 Amended Proposal=
=20
contained a methodology to adjust both Slice and non-Slice power rates=20
multiple times each year during the rate period for changes in BPA=01,s=20
augmentation costs. In fact, the issue now is not a Slice vs. non-Slice=20
issue.  Rather, it is an issue of which power products subject to LB CRAC=
=20
recover what amount of the additional net augmentation costs.

The approaches to recovering net augmentation costs in May ROD and December=
=20
2000 Amended Proposal are different than that proposed in the Supplemental=
=20
Proposal.  It simply is not possible to explain some distinction that is=20
alleged to be introduced in this Supplemental Proposal when neither the May=
=20
2000 or December 2000 proposals contained no method for calculating and the=
n=20
apportioning these costs in one way between individual power products.  No=
=20
such segmentation was required in either of those two prior proposals.

In the May ROD, there was only one CRAC, which allocated the amount of=20
revenues to be raised by non-Slicer power products  based on revenues=20
(WP-02-FS-BPA-02A, p. 283).  However, that one CRAC did not attempt to=20
collect BPA=01,s net augmentation costs as the currently proposed LB CRAC=
=20
attempted to do.

In the December Amended Proposal, BPA proposed two very different methods f=
or=20
collecting net augmentation costs from customers.  Slice share of=20
augmentation costs was determined based on share of the FBS.  Non-Slice pow=
er=20
products=01, share of net augmentation costs was determined using loads. =
=20
Together, these two approaches collected more than 100% of BPA=01,s net=20
augmentation costs.
So, the Supplemental Proposal contains a new methodology to recover net=20
augmentation costs using twice-annual rate adjustments to all power product=
s=20
subject to LB CRAC.  This new approach required a new methodology, and, as =
a=20
result, this new methodology cannot be directly compared to methodologies i=
n=20
the earlier proposals.

Second, turning to the broader question of the justification for using=20
revenues, there are several reasons why BPA considers this to be the correc=
t=20
approach.

The first policy objective driving the Amended Proposal and Supplemental=20
Proposal is that =01&It should be as simple as possible.=018 (WP-02-E-BPA-7=
0, pg.=20
6, line 4).  One principle underlying settlement discussions was that the L=
B=20
CRAC method ought to assure that each power product subject to the LB CRAC =
is=20
charged with recovering the same percentage increase in revenue.

The approach to determining the equal percentage increases in revenue=20
required from each power product subject to LB CRAC is to use revenues in t=
he=20
determination of the LB CRAC%.  In this calculation, net augmentation cost=
=20
are spread across the sum of all expected revenues from all power products=
=20
subject to LB CRAC for the entire 6-month duration of the LB CRAC.  The=20
resulting percentage, referred to as LB CRAC%, is then applied equally to=
=20
each power product subject to the LB CRAC.  This approach assures that each=
=20
separate power product, subject to the LB CRAC, will then have a revised ra=
te=20
that is determined using the same percentage increase in required revenue.

Additionally, the problem BPA is grappling with is one of sufficient=20
revenues.  Net augmentation costs are expressed in dollars.  Revenues from=
=20
power products without the LB CRAC is expressed in dollars. By spreading th=
e=20
former dollars over the latter dollars, and applying the resulting percenta=
ge=20
to revenues without the LB CRAC, results in incremental dollars required fr=
om=20
each separate power product that is subject to the LB CRAC.   This appears =
to=20
BPA to be a very fair and equitable approach to recover net augmentation=20
costs.

response_text:
The following two tables are excerpted out of WP-02-E-BPA-77, page 9, lines=
=20
4-26.


Table Illustrating JCG Method










Table Illustrating BPA Method













Before beginning the comparison of the two tables, it should be pointed out=
=20
that the tables calculate gross augmentation costs.  We left out the step=
=20
that calculates the net augmentation costs.  As a result, the =01&Total=018=
 line=20
dollar amounts ($6M and $6.2M in the JCG table, and $6M and $6M in the BPA=
=20
table) should all be reduced by the amount of augmentation resale revenue. =
=20
However, since this modification will not affect the comparison requested i=
n=20
the data request, let us continue as if the =01&Total=018 line dollar amoun=
ts are=20
already net of the augmentation revenue. See the attachment to the data=20
response.



















Another item that may be confusing is the item labeled =01&Pre-purchase =01=
) 0 day=20
rule=018.  This is the incremental cost associated with purchases made betw=
een=20
the 120-day cut-off and the 0-day cut-off.

Also, a crosswalk of each table showing how it corresponds to a variable or=
=20
equation in section f is not possible since section f reflects the BPA=20
method, not the JCG method.  Perhaps an overview of BPA=01,s perspective on=
 the=20
difference between the JCG method and the BPA method will be helpful.

JCG calculated the augmentation costs using two different cost pools, one=
=20
cost pool for the Slice product (using the 120 day rule), and a second cost=
=20
pool for all other products (using the 0 day rule).  The products then=20
collected a portion of the augmentation costs associated with a specific=20
rule.  When these two cost pools yield different net augmentation costs=20
(which they usually will unless all of the augmentation is purchased under=
=20
the 120-day rule), the JCG method doesn=01,t collect the actual amount of e=
ither=20
of those pools from Slice or non-Slice.  Rather it collects a proportion of=

each of the cost pools.

In contrast to the JCG method, the BPA method distributes the costs using t=
he=20
120-day rule proportionally between the Slice and non-Slice products, and=
=20
then assesses all the incremental cost from using the 0-day rule rather tha=
n=20
the 120-day rule to the non-Slice products.  In contrast to JCG method, thi=
s=20
assures that all the actual incremental net augmentation costs calculated b=
y=20
replacing the =01&120-day=018 rule with the =01&0-day=018 rule are recovere=
d  from=20
purchasers of non-Slice power products.  In addition, this also assures tha=
t=20
purchasers of the Slice product do not bear any nearer term market prices=
=20
fluctuations.

Now for a short description of each line in the two tables, and a compariso=
n=20
of the differences.  The example assumes that we don=01,t actually purchase=
 all=20
of our augmentation, that some of it is served from BPA=01,s secondary, or =
is=20
bought in the spot market.

=01&Pre-purchase =01) 120 day rule=018 is the total cost of augmentation pu=
rchases=20
made at least 120 days prior to the month of delivery.  This amount is $2M =
in=20
both tables in both columns.  This amount represents the sum of DIURNALACA=
=20
for the six-month period.  This would have represented DIURNALACA(S) in the=
=20
GRSPs proposed by the JCG in their Direct Case.

=01&Pre-purchase =01) 0 day rule=018 is the additional cost of pre-purchase=
s made less=20
than 120 days prior to the month of delivery.  This amount is $1M in both=
=20
tables in the non-Slice column.  The 0-day rule pre-purchases are not=20
applicable to the Slice product, thus the N/A in the Slice column in both=
=20
tables.  If =01&Pre-purchase =01) 120 day rule=018 and =01&Pre-purchase =01=
) 0 day rule=018=20
were summed the sum would represent DIURNALACA(NS) in the GRSPs proposed by=
=20
the customers.  Note that the Pre-purchase =01) 0 day rule appears in a=20
different row in the BPA table since BPA has proposed that these incrementa=
l=20
cost enter the calculations at a different point.

Short position is the cost of the amount of AAMTA that is not pre-purchased=
. =20
This is the amount that is valued at PRICE in the GRSPs.  In the JCG, the=
=20
short position is different between the Slice and non-Slice columns.  This =
is=20
because the example has BPA purchasing some additional augmentation ($1M=20
worth) under the 0-day rule, and there is a corresponding reduction in the=
=20
value of BPA=01,s short position.  The change also reflects that the short=
=20
position is valued using different PRICEs for the 120 day rule and the 0 da=
y=20
rule.  In the BPA example, Short position is $3M for both Slice and non-Sli=
ce=20
products, and the difference (-$0.8M) is found in the row =01&Short positio=
n 0=20
day rule=018

=01&Buydown=018 is the cost of all buydowns.  It is the same in both tables=
, for=20
both Slice and non-Slice products.  In the examples BPA spent $1M buying do=
wn=20
load.

=01&Total=018 is the gross cost of augmentation.  As stated above, it shoul=
d be=20
reduced by the augmentation resale revenue.  To continue on, let us assume=
=20
that =01&Total=018 has been reduced by augmentation resale revenue, and rep=
resents=20
the net augmentation costs.  In the JCG  example, =01&Total=018 is $6M for =
Slice=20
and $6.2M for non-Slice.  These would represent NACA(S) and NACA(NS) in the=
=20
GRSPs proposed by the JCG in their Direct Case..  In the BPA example, Total=
=20
is $6M for both Slice and non-Slice.  This represents NACA in the BPA GRSPs=
.

=01&Percent of CRACable revenue=018 is the same in both tables.  The exampl=
e shows=20
that the Slice revenue is 30% of the total CRACable revenue, and the=20
non-Slice revenue is 70% of the total CRACable revenue.

=01&LB CRAC Costs=018 only appears in the BPA example.  It is the NACA dist=
ributed=20
between Slice and non-Slice products in proportion to actual revenue.

=01&Pre-purchase 0 day rule=018 and =01&Short position 0 day rule=018 are t=
he changes in=20
the valuation of pre-purchases ($1M) and Short position (-$0.8M) between th=
e=20
120 day rule and the 0 day rule.  The net difference of $0.2M is equivalent=
=20
to the difference that is seen in =01&Total=018 in the JCG example (the dif=
ference=20
between $6M and $6.2M).  This difference is also equivalent to NACDIFF in t=
he=20
BPA GRSPs.

=01&Total LB CRAC Cost(s)=018 is the cost that the Slice and non-Slice grou=
ps true=20
up to.  In the JCG example, the Slice product trues up to 30% of $6M, or=20
$1.8M while the non-Slice products true up to 70% of $6.2M for a total from=
=20
both groups of $6.14M.  In BPA=01,s example, the Slice product pays 30% of =
$6M=20
or $1.8M (the same as in the JCG example) while the non-Slice products pay=
=20
70% of $6M plus the net difference between valuation of net augmentation=20
costs using the 120 day rule and valuation using the 0 day rule.  The=20
non-Slice amount is $4.2M plus $0.2M or $4.4M.

For purposes of this Request, ""disclose and/or produce"" has the meanings 
described below.  With respect to oral communications, ""disclose and/or

substantive content of the communication; the identity and organizational 
affiliation of the communicating individuals; whether the communication 
occurred in person or by telephone; the location of the communication if in 
person; the identity of any witnesses to the communications, including all 
individuals in the room if the communication occurred by speakerphone; and 
whether the communication was made in the presence of or after coordination 
with BPA counsel (if so, identify such counsel).  For purposes of this 
Request, you need not ""disclose and/or produce"" oral communications that

written communications and to describe with particularity the location where 
such communications were found and/or stored, including the identity of the 
individual with possession or control of the written communications; to 
describe with particularity the circumstances under which they were generated

official file in the rate case.

response_text:
Exhibit 1 reflects e-mails currently on file. The computer of Terry Mundorf 
suffered a virus attack on or about 2/15/01, which corrupted the Outlook 
program.  In order to repair the damage, all incoming e-mail was purged on or 
about 2/20/01, which eliminated records of incoming e-mail prior to that date.

WPAG has no records of meetings or telephone calls that requested in 
DS-WA:015-017, so the information contained in Exhibit 2 is based on best 
recollection.

For written communications, see Exhibit 1.
For oral communications, see Exhibit 2.

The exhibits and attachments are available in BPA's Data Response Room.

that goes into putting one together.

Enron's transactions.

how the financial principals discussed  relate to  Enron deals.

Lunch still good for you guys?  Anytime is good for me, but noon or after
would be better, if this meeting runs late.  What time is good for you
guys?  Also, suggestions for where would be good.  It probably needs to be
central downtown since Giron is on the south side.  Let me know.
